<p>"Mamma, darling, you'll take me to the Inauguration
Ball, that's a love."</p>

<p>"Oh, my baby, what an absurd idea! And you only
sixteen!"</p>

<p>"I'm as tall as you, mamma, and I only look small
because my dresses are too short. I wish you would let
out the tucks to hide my ankles&mdash;there now!"</p>

<p>"But, Precious, you have the prettiest feet and ankles in
the world."</p>

<p>"I don't care; I want my dresses long, and my
hair put up. I'm tired of being only a schoolgirl! Everybody
in Washington will be at the Inauguration Ball. I
want to go, too, and shake hands with the new president."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear; the next Inauguration Ball will be
time enough for you."</p>

<p>"Four years! Why, then I shall be twen-ty. Quite
an old maid, mamma, dear, with crows' feet and
wrinkles."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans, the handsome wife of a noted Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Senator, threw back her graceful golden head, and laughed
softly:</p>

<p>"Oh, what a ridiculous child!"</p>

<p>But her dark-blue eyes lingered tenderly on the lovely
upturned face, for Precious was on an ottoman at her
mother's feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans was the mother of three children&mdash;a son
and two daughters. Precious was the youngest&mdash;"the
baby," they called her&mdash;and, like all babies, she was
spoiled, and liked to have her own way, always wheedling
her parents until she got whatever she wanted.</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, you will let me go," she cried teasingly.</p>

<p>"Go where?" exclaimed a musical voice, as a tall, dark,
regal beauty entered the library. "Go where?" she repeated.
"And what is the baby teasing for now,
mamma?"</p>

<p>Precious Winans lifted her golden head from her
mother's knee, and turning her pansy-blue eyes on her
queenly sister replied, with the air of a little princess:</p>

<p>"Ethel, I've made up my mind to go to the Inauguration
Ball."</p>

<p>"The ball, indeed?" and Ethel shook with laughter in
which her mother joined.</p>

<p>Ere the echo of their mirth died away a tall, dark,
handsome man entered the room&mdash;their father, from whom
the elder girl inherited her dusky beauty, while the
younger was the image of her lovely blond mother.</p>

<p>"What is the joke about?" he asked genially, and his
wife replied:</p>

<p>"Precious has a new notion in her silly little noddle.
She wants to attend the Inauguration Ball."</p>

<p>"The idea!" laughed Ethel, gently sarcastic.</p>

<p>But Precious had fled to her father, and was hanging
on his neck. As he clasped the lissome form to his heart
he asked earnestly:</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?" echoed his pretty pet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, papa, she is too young," cried Ethel, almost
angrily.</p>

<p>"Don't listen to her, papa. She doesn't want me to
have one bit of fun. But I will go to the ball, for you
will say yes, won't you, my darling old love?" and she
stroked his rippling black whiskers with her dainty mite
of a hand, and gazed into his eyes with innocent confidence.</p>

<p>He hugged the little pleader tight, and looked over the
top of her golden head at his wife.</p>

<p>"What say you, Grace, my dear? Isn't she big enough
to go to the ball?"</p>

<p>"I'm as tall as mamma. You needn't laugh, Ethel,"
cried Precious, and waited eagerly for her mother's
reply.</p>

<p>The gentle lady said sweetly:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to disappoint my dear little girl, but she
is too young to go into society yet, and she would have to
make her <i>début</i> as a young lady before she went to a grand
ball."</p>

<p>"I don't care if I'm not a young lady, mamma; I'm determined
to go to the ball," cried Precious, with hysterical
symptoms, and Mrs. Winans sighed gently.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my darling girl, I'm sorry to refuse you, but&mdash;"
she began, and paused in dismay, for a sound of
petulant weeping filled the room. Precious lay in her
father's arms transformed into a Niobe.</p>

<p>"Oh, Precious, pray don't be such a baby," implored
Ethel impatiently, but the sobbing only grew louder,
and between whiles came the pathetic plaint:</p>

<p>"Nobody cares for me."</p>

<p>Those tears and sobs melted the father's doting heart.
He cried out pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Poor little love, her heart is almost broken. Do let
her go, mamma."</p>

<p>"Papa is the only friend I have in the world!" wailed
the diplomatic little darling, and he pressed her closer to
his throbbing heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, Gracie, how can you refuse?" he exclaimed, but
Ethel cried out pettishly:</p>

<p>"Papa, you have spoiled Precious until she is a perfect
baby, and if she cried for the moon I believe you'd try to
have a ladder built up to it. You always find it easy
enough to refuse me when I ask imprudent things, and I
don't think you ought to take sides against mamma in
this. Let Precious wait a few years before she comes
out."</p>

<p>But dismal sobs were the only answer to this plea, and
Precious wept, persuasively:</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, darling papa, do say that I may go, for
mamma will do anything you wish."</p>

<p>The senator's pleading dark eyes met the anxious blue
ones of his wife, and he said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Dearest, she wants to go so very, very much, and it
will break her sweet little heart if you refuse. Besides,
this is different from a regular ball, for thousands and
thousands of people attend the Inauguration Ball just to
see the new president. There will be a great crush as
usual, and you will bring the girls home very soon, I
know. So for this one time I think we may humor our
baby's curiosity. Now dry your eyes, my pet."</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling! you darling!" cried Precious ecstatically,
and lifted her face, all lovely and damp like a
rain-washed rose. She embraced him rapturously, then
flew to her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma, you shall never repent this, for I'll be as
good as gold hereafter."</p>

<p>Ethel had turned away and left the room with a frowning
brow and darkly flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"He loves her best," she murmured bitterly. "He
would never have yielded like that to my entreaties for
anything against dear mamma's wish. Ah, why is it so?
Am I not beautiful and good, and his elder daughter?
Why should Precious be always first in my noble father's
heart?"</p>

<p>That jealous heart-cry strikes the keynote of our story,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
dear reader, for had the senator not loved Precious best,
this story of Ethel's temptation and her sister's suffering
would never have been written.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ethel Winans was bitterly unhappy.</p>

<p>Unhappy? and why?</p>

<p>Externally she had everything to make her blessed.</p>

<p>Young, beautiful, healthy, the fortunate daughter of a
rich and distinguished statesman, this girl had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"But lain in the lilies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fed on the roses of life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Milton has aptly written:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mind is its own place, and in itself<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ethel Winans' life stream had been poisoned at its very
source by a baleful jealousy.</p>

<p>Those who knew her gifted father best were aware that
his early married life had been embittered by the faults of a
passionately jealous nature intent on supremacy in everything.
This elder daughter had inherited his beauty and
his temperament. Every parental influence was working
against her happiness.</p>

<p>She went with a weary, listless step to her own apartments,
and fell heavily upon a silken divan. Her red lips
were trembling, and tears began to rain from her beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Why was I ever born?" she cried angrily. "No one
cares for poor Ethel! Mamma, in spite of her denials,
loves my brother Earle the best, and papa worships Precious.
If I were dead they would scarcely miss me."</p>

<p>She began to pace up and down the luxurious room, her
rich crimson silk gown trailing soundlessly over the thick
velvet carpet, her loosened tresses pouring in a dusky torrent
below her waist, her lovely jeweled hands writhing
together in agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"How I love him, my noble, handsome father!" she
cried. "But ever since Precious was born, before I was
three years old, she has supplanted me in everything. I
can remember it all although I was so young. She
pushed me from my mother's breast, she crowded me
from my father's heart. I was no longer the petted baby.
I must give way to Little Blue Eyes, as they call her, and
from the first I hated my rival. When I was little I used
to strike her, until my mother's gentle teachings made me
ashamed, and then I tried to love my little sister for
mamma's sake. I do love her. God knows I love her, for
who could help it, she is so sweet and lovely? Yet there
are times&mdash;horrible times&mdash;when Satan seems to possess
my soul, and I give way to something that is awful&mdash;to
jealous hate and fury&mdash;and then, oh, then, I wish that
Precious were dead, or that I had never been born. Once
I confessed all to mamma, and she shuddered and wept
at my wickedness. But she clasped me in her tender
arms, and told me that she loved me&mdash;oh, very, very much
and that she would pray for me daily! Dear mamma! she
is an angel, and I am a wicked, rebellious girl, and frighten
every one with my fits of temper and imperious ways.
And I forget to pray for myself as mamma bade me do,
and when I forget, the Evil One gets possession of my
weak soul."</p>

<p>She fell on her knees, she lifted her streaming dark eyes
heavenward.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven help me, make me a better girl, keep me
from hating my dear little sister, and save me from my
own evil nature!" she prayed, with desperate fervor.</p>

<p>It was the fourth day of March, and Washington was
full of strangers drawn thither to witness the Inauguration
ceremonies attendant upon the new president taking
the oath of office as ruler of the nation.</p>

<p>But nature had frowned on everything that day, and
from early dawn till midnight her tears poured in torrents
upon the vast throngs that surged ceaselessly through the
magnificent broad avenues of the beautiful city. The
wind raged wildly, and the rain fell in sheets, as
though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heart of heaven were breaking<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In tears o'er the fallen earth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Along the route of the procession, from the White House
to the Capitol, Pennsylvania avenue was packed with a dense
mass of people, upon whose forest of umbrellas the magnificent
decorations of flags and bunting overhead dripped
red and blue ink as they hung forlornly over the scene.
The windows of the houses were filled with curious faces
and the grand stands erected here and there for the sightseers
were occupied, too, in spite of the weather, for no
one seemed to have stayed indoors for fear of the elements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Hundreds of thousands of people seemed to be
packed upon the pavements, jostling each other with their
umbrellas, and patronizing the busy fakirs who peddled
presidential badges and photographs, while ever and anon
rose the plaintive call of the diligent vender of Philadelphia
cough drops. Altogether the day was dismal in the
extreme. The drenched people looked ridiculous, and the
glory of the procession was considerably dampened from
the same cause.</p>

<p>But the day with its stormy skies, its surging throngs,
and fitful enthusiasm was over now. The new president
was installed in the White House, the old president was
deposed. "<i>Le roi est mort! Vive le roi!</i>"</p>

<p>Still Nature wept tumultuously, for with nightfall the
storm increased in violence. Black, portentous clouds
scurried over the face of the sky, and sheets of icy cold
rain poured upon the earth.</p>

<p>But all this downpour did not check the ardor of the
tens of thousands of people who flocked to the Inauguration
Ball in the immense new Pension building. The
avenues were thronged with carriages, and they literally
blocked the square around the building, while within all
was like fairy-land with splendid decorations, brilliant
lights, black coats of civilians, gay uniforms of soldiers,
brilliant costumes of foreign legations, and lovely women
whose magnificent jewels radiated fire, while over all rose
the swell of music. The new president was there with his
family, and willful Precious Winans had duly made his
acquaintance, the honor she had so much coveted.</p>

<p>And beautiful, passionate Ethel, with her flashing eyes
and her proud smile?</p>

<p>Since we first met her several weeks ago a change has
come over this reckless spirit.</p>

<p>The passion of love has thrown its golden glamour over
her heart.</p>

<p>At a brilliant entertainment ten days ago she had met
a stranger, an Englishman of rank and wealth, who was
just now being lionized by American society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Chester was young, handsome, fascinating,
and caused many a flutter in feminine hearts, but he soon
singled out the brilliant belle, Miss Winans, as the bright
particular star of his worship, and it was soon suspected
that the girl, whose conquests had been legion in her two
successful seasons, had been touched at last by Cupid's
arrows. Society began to prophesy a match.</p>

<p>Ethel was radiant in the bliss of this dawning passion.</p>

<p>She foresaw, in a worshiping love and a brilliant marriage,
an escape from the life that her jealous nature made
at times unendurable.</p>

<p>"As Lady Chester I should leave my father's house,
where Precious has supplanted me in all my rights. In
my grand English home I should reign queen of my husband's
heart, and in time the wounds of slighted love in
my father's home might heal and be forgotten," she
thought gladly, and there was triumph in the anticipation
of this brilliant match, for she did not believe Precious
could ever win a title, in spite of her charms.</p>

<p>"She is lovely, but she is not queenly, as I am. She
would not grace a title," she thought proudly.</p>

<p>At the ball that night she wore Lord Chester's flowers,
and he hung over her devotedly, but he had not yet seen
Precious. Her mother kept her resolutely in the background.
The senator's entreaties had forced her to bring
her younger daughter, but she was determined that the
girl's presence should not be known any more than could
be helped. She wanted to keep this lovely pearl secluded
from society as long as she could.</p>

<p>So, withdrawn into a flowery alcove with Precious, she
scarcely mingled at all with the surging mass of people
whose vast numbers made dancing quite an impossibility.
The senator remained with them part of the time, but was
often called off by friends, and sometimes left them to
mingle with the crowd.</p>

<p>Precious, a perfect picture of beauty in a white Empire
silk gown, with her golden curls all loose over her shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
remained demurely by her mother's side, the radiant
light in her blue eyes and the flush on her cheeks showing
how much she enjoyed the brilliant scene.</p>

<p>Suddenly a very distinguished looking man, white-haired,
and in the uniform of some foreign service, with
glittering orders on his breast, caught sight of Mrs. Winans
in her secluded alcove, and hastened to speak to the
beautiful lady.</p>

<p>Precious did not care about the old gentleman. She
moved back, and looked another way to escape an introduction.</p>

<p>"Ah, Baron Nugent," cried the lady and for ten minutes
he lingered beside her, then moved on.</p>

<p>"Precious," she cried, looking around, but there was no
answer. Precious had disappeared.</p>

<p>"She is hiding, to tease me," smiled Mrs. Winans, and
began to search for her daughter with a smile on her
lips.</p>

<p>But Precious was nowhere to be seen, and she presently
grew quite alarmed.</p>

<p>"She will be lost in this dense crowd. It was very
thoughtless in her to leave my side. I must find her
father and send him to search for her," cried the frightened
mother.</p>

<p>But for some time she could not see her husband, or
any one else that she knew.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon Ethel and Lord Chester sitting
close to a vine-wreathed pillar, seemingly absorbed in each
other. The handsome young nobleman was leaning over
Ethel with an air of devotion that seemed only the due of
her dark and sparkling beauty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans gave a little suppressed sob of joy at finding
some one that she knew. She went up to the lovers,
and cried tremulously:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ethel, have you seen Precious? She is lost!"</p>

<p>Ethel looked up with a frown at the interruption of her
charming conversation, and answered coldly:</p>

<p>"No, mamma; I thought she was with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was, but a little while ago Baron Nugent stopped
to speak to me, and when I looked around again Precious
had disappeared as completely as if she had sunk through
the floor. She must have strayed into the crowd, the
thoughtless child, and got lost. Oh, if I could find her
father and send him to look for her!"</p>

<p>"I will be very glad to bring him to you, madam," exclaimed
Lord Chester, courteously and he hurried away
to seek the senator.</p>

<p>Ethel pouted angrily.</p>

<p>"If you had only stayed where you were, mamma, Precious
would have come back to you directly. You are making
a great fuss over nothing," she declared, and Mrs.
Winans trembled at the jealous flash in the large dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"My dear, I am very sorry I interrupted you," she
said, in her low, gentle voice. "But I was so alarmed
over Precious I did not think. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive, but it is just like Precious,
raising an excitement, and spoiling every one's pleasure.
She should never have come," Ethel replied ungraciously.</p>

<p>At that moment Lord Chester came hurrying back with
Senator Winans in tow.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul, I have lost Precious," his wife cried with a
choking sob.</p>

<p>"No, dear, we will find her presently, I'm sure," he
said cheerfully, but with an anxious light in his eyes.
Then he explained that while she was talking to the baron
he had beckoned Precious away in order to present her to
a friend of his, a cabinet minister. While they were all
talking they had spied the president leaving, and bidding
Precious remain where she was until he came back her
father hurried forward for a few good-night words with
him.</p>

<p>"I am sure I was not absent more than fifteen minutes
from her side, but when I returned she was gone. I supposed
she had made her way back to you, and was searching
for you both when I met Lord Chester."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"She never came back. Oh, my darling, where are
you? What has become of you?" moaned the anxious
mother, and her lovely, delicate face paled with
fear.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, Grace. I will soon find her for
you," her husband cried, and Lord Chester, eager to be of
use, added:</p>

<p>"I will assist you if you will describe your daughter to
me."</p>

<p>Senator Winans cried impulsively:</p>

<p>"She is the most beautiful girl you ever saw. Only
sixteen, with blue eyes like velvet pansies, golden curls
sweeping to her waist, a white silk gown, and pearls on her
lovely white neck."</p>

<p>A low, muttered word came from Ethel's lips, but they
did not catch its import, and turned away. Only her
tearful mother saw the livid pallor that overspread
the beautiful face and the flash of anger in the dark
eyes.</p>

</div></div>


<p>An hour's frantic search convinced Senator Winans
that his daughter was not in the immense ballroom, and
inquiry among the door-keepers brought to light something
very startling.</p>

<p>A young man had left the ballroom an hour before,
carrying an unconscious girl in his arms.</p>

<p>He had told the doorkeeper that she was his sister, that
she had fainted in the crowd, and that he was going to
put her in his carriage, and take her home.</p>

<p>When the man described the beauty of the unconscious
girl, the soft white silk gown, and the long golden curls,
the agonized senator could no longer doubt that his darling
had been kidnaped by some villain, and carried off
to some terrible unknown fate.</p>

<p>It was terrible to think that such a thing could be in
that gala scene among those thousands of joyous people,
and in that blaze of light and splendor. It was like a
sword in her father's heart.</p>

<p>His face grew ashen, his eyes blazed, and he swore
the most terrible revenge on the fiend who had stolen
Precious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling, this news will break her
mother's heart!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"But she has another daughter left to comfort her,"
ventured the elegant young Englishman.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have Ethel. She is a good daughter, but
Precious was our favorite, our darling."</p>

<p>"But why? Miss Winans is very charming," cried Lord
Chester, a little jealous for the beautiful girl he admired
so much.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ethel is charming, but so was my little Precious.
She was charming and winsome, too, my youngest born,
my darling, the idol of my heart!" groaned the senator,
completely overcome by his trouble.</p>

<p>Lord Chester began to feel an eager curiosity over the
missing girl. Was she, indeed, as lovely and winsome as
her father declared? She must be if her charms exceeded
Ethel's.</p>

<p>He held out a sympathetic hand to the stricken
father.</p>

<p>"General, pray command my services in this sad
affair to assist you in all possible ways," he exclaimed
cordially.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lord Chester, for we must begin to follow
up the clews at once. But my heart bleeds for my
wife. I fear this shock will almost kill her. My lord, if
you will order my carriage, I will send her home with
Ethel, telling her that perhaps Precious has somehow
found her way home. Not a word of the truth yet. It
must be broken to her later, and very gently. She must
think that I am still searching here, while in fact I shall
be on the track of the kidnaper. Oh, Heavens
every moment is an agony, until I find my child
again!"</p>

<p>And later on, when his wife and daughter were gone,
and he was rolling in a cab to the office of a great detective,
he confided to the young Englishman a brief page
from his romantic earlier life.</p>

<p>"My only son, Earle, who is at present in Europe, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
kidnaped by a lunatic when he was an infant, and it was
over four years before we recovered him. He was in my
care at the time, and I was blamed for his loss. My wife
had brain fever, and almost died, and the pensive shade
on her face now was left there by that early grief. Think
what it would be to her now to lose Precious in the same
terrible fashion. She is a noble Christian woman, but I
fear that she would curse me and never forgive me if our
darling daughter should be lost like that while in my care.
Oh, why was I so careless? Why did I not remember
that there are always human wolves watching&mdash;for
prey?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans sobbed bitterly all the way home from
the ball, but Ethel was too angry to offer one word of
comfort.</p>

<p>Her father's praise of Precious rankled like a poisoned
arrow in her heart.</p>

<p>"The most beautiful girl he ever saw! How dared he
say it? I wonder if Lord Chester would say so, too, if he
saw her? Would he like her blue eyes better than my
dark ones? Would he think her golden curls prettier than
my raven tresses? Woe be to her if he did, for now he is
almost my declared lover, and if she won him from me I
should be tempted to take a terrible revenge on both,"
she thought bitterly, forgetting that the deadliest revenge
often recoils on the hand that deals the blow.</p>

<p>They passed into the broad hall, where they were met
by Mrs. Winans' privileged attendant, Norah, who had
nursed all her children.</p>

<p>"Norah! Norah! has Precious come home?" cried her
mistress anxiously.</p>

<p>The woman stared in surprise at the question.</p>

<p>"No, madam, she is not here. I thought she was to
come back with you! Why, what ails you that you look
so pale and wild? Oh, she is fainting! Help! help! we
must carry her to her room!"</p>

<p>They bore the limp figure upstairs, and laid it on the
bed. Ethel knelt by her, weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, dear mamma, speak to me! Oh, Norah,
why does she lie still so long? Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"No, it's only a swoon. I've brought her safely through
many like it, poor dear. But tell me what has happened,
Miss Ethel? Where is your father and your sister, my
little nursling?"</p>

<p>Ethel told her briefly what had happened, adding:</p>

<p>"Papa sent us home and remained, to search for
Precious."</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy!" sobbed nurse Norah, then she
busied herself about her mistress.</p>

<p>Ethel stood idly watching her, with dazed eyes, her
head in a whirl. She was not thinking of her lost sister,
nor her stricken mother. Her restless thoughts had gone
back to her handsome English lover.</p>

<p>She was thinking:</p>

<p>"When mamma came upon us so suddenly he was
about to make a declaration of his love. I saw it in his
eyes, it was trembling on his lips; but mamma came between
with the name of Precious&mdash;that name that always
comes between me and everything! Was it an evil omen,
I wonder, or will he tell me to-morrow that he loves
me?"</p>

</div></div>


<p>In the gray dawn of the wild March morning Senator
Winans came home alone, looking ten years older, the
stamp of despair on his dark, handsome face.</p>

<p>He went at once to his wife, and found her lying awake
in a fever of suspense and anxiety.</p>

<p>When she saw him enter alone she started up with a cry
of keen despair:</p>

<p>"Precious! Oh, where is Precious?"</p>

<p>Her husband knelt by her side, clasped the feverish
little hands, and kissed the woeful white face, all wet with
tears, like a rain-drenched lily.</p>

<p>"Be brave, be patient, my dearest, for you must bear
this cruel suspense yet a little longer," he sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul, you have not found her yet? Then she
must be dead, our little darling!"</p>

<p>He had decided to tell her the truth. It would be better
than the anguish of wretched uncertainty, so he broke
it to her gently, the story of the golden-haired girl
who had been carried out of the ballroom unconscious.</p>

<p>"It must have been our golden-haired darling. I believe
she has been kidnaped for the sake of a ransom; so
cheer up, my darling, for the wretches will not harm our
pet; they will keep her safe and well to earn the reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they will expect to be offered in the morning papers. And
I have attended to that already, Grace, for my advisers
think it will be best to give great publicity to the affair,
as in that case it may come to the knowledge of some persons
who may be able to give us an unexpected clew. Oh,
my wife; do not sob so bitterly. Our darling shall soon be
found, I swear it," and for the sake of the anguish she
saw in his eyes the poor mother fought with her sorrow,
and tried to find a glimmer of light in the Cimmerian
darkness.</p>

<p>But it was cruel, cruel, for the horror of the present was
only augmented by the memory of the past. Her eldest
born, her precious boy, had been stolen in his babyhood,
and four years elapsed before he was recovered. It had
taken all the strength of youth and hope to endure that
cross. Now she was older, frailer, and she knew she
could not bear another such agony and live.</p>

<p>But her husband's seeming hopefulness put a gleam of
sunshine in her heart, and for his sake, because she loved
him very dearly, she would not add to his remorseful grief
by one reproachful word.</p>

<p>The morning papers in glaring black headlines chronicled
the abduction of the senator's favorite daughter and
the princely ransom he had offered for her restoration.
Excitement ran high over the terrible sensation, and
stories of the girl's wonderful grace and beauty passed
from lip to lip. The studio of a famous artist who had
but just completed the portrait of Precious for her father
was thronged with gazers. He could not deny them, for
it was hoped that familiarity with her looks might in some
way help the search for the missing girl.</p>

<p>Among the first of the curious visitors to the studio was
handsome Lord Chester.</p>

<p>The senator's earnest praises of his favorite child rang
continuously in the young man's head.</p>

<p>His eager curiosity drove him to the studio of the
famous artist, and when he stood at last before the full-length
portrait he could not turn his eyes away; they lingered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in rapture on the pictured loveliness of Precious
Winans.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>To the day of his death Arthur, Lord Chester, carried
this picture in his memory and his heart&mdash;this picture of
a girl standing by a magnificent large mastiff with one
tiny white hand holding his silver collar. Beneath her
fairy feet was daisied grass, and her simple white gown and
the broad straw hat she carried on her arm seemed to fit
the spring-time that was imaged in the golden lengths of
rippling hair. So she stood&mdash;"a sight to make an old
man young"&mdash;Ethel's younger sister, the senator's favorite.</p>

<p>The words of a poet of his own fair land leaped to his
lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Sovereign lady in fair field<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Myself for such a face had boldly died."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later in the day he called at the Winans mansion, and
Ethel received him alone. Her mamma was too ill and
nervous to see any one.</p>

<p>Never had the queenly Ethel looked more charming.
No shade of anxiety dimmed the dark radiance of her
eyes. She had slept long and late, and when she awoke and
heard that Precious was not yet found she laughed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
said that she was sure that her sister had eloped with
some handsome young man, and would be coming home
in a few days from her bridal tour, with her husband, to
ask papa's forgiveness.</p>

<p>And she repeated this to Lord Chester when he expressed
solicitude over her sister's fate.</p>

<p>"I am not at all uneasy, my lord," she cried lightly; "I
think it very likely that Precious has eloped with one of
her tutors. Papa had several young men coming here to
teach my sister music, and drawing, and dancing. Of
course her French governess was always present. But she
scarcely understood a word of English, so it was easy
enough for one of them to make love to her if he wished,
and Precious was just the kind of pretty, willful simpleton
to fall in love with a nobody and marry him."</p>

<p>A keen, inexplicable pain tore the young man's heart
at those words, and it seemed to him that Ethel's levity
amounted to heartlessness. He looked gravely at her with
his dark-gray eyes, and it seemed to him that there was
something lacking in her beauty that he had not missed
last night, but he did not realize as yet that the change
was in himself.</p>

<p>He would have denied it if any one had taxed him
with being in love with a girl whom he knew only by her
portrait.</p>

<p>Only last night he had adored charming Ethel Winans.
It was only her mother's interruption that had prevented
him from laying his heart and title at her feet. The
words had trembled on his lips while he looked at her with
his heart in his eyes.</p>

<p>Why did he not speak to-day?</p>

<p>The opportunity was very favorable, for it was but seldom
he could find the brilliant belle alone.</p>

<p>And Ethel's languid air, just touched with the softness
of love, was very inviting. It was just the gentle mood in
which a girl is likely to accept a proposal.</p>

<p>But he did not propose, although he said to himself that
really he ought to, and he was afraid she expected it, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
last night. But really it might not be quite correct to
speak just now when the family was crushed with grief
over the kidnaping of a beloved daughter. He would
postpone the declaration.</p>

<p>In truth last night's zest was lacking. Last night
Ethel had seemed to him a peerless goddess. To-day she
was only an ordinary mortal&mdash;beautiful, but&mdash;not as
divine as her younger sister.</p>

<p>If he had dreamed of the mad passion of jealousy surging
under her calm exterior he would never have uttered his
next words:</p>

<p>"I saw your sister's portrait at Valentine's studio to-day.
Her beauty merits all her father's praise."</p>

<p>She bit her scarlet lip and tore to pieces a rose in her
fingers.</p>

<p>"The portrait is flattered. Precious is not half so
beautiful," she answered coldly, and a sudden constraint
came between them. Lord Chester, blind to the smoldering
fury under the long black lashes, thought her weary
of him, and soon took leave.</p>

<p>Ethel, left alone in the splendid room, with the scattered
rose petals at her feet, flung out her arms with a
gesture of rebellious despair, and moaned bitterly:</p>

<p>"She has won my lover's heart with that fatal, luring,
childish beauty! How can I help but hate her now?"</p>

<p>The evening's post brought a mysterious type-written
letter to Senator Winans. It ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have made a mistake. I did not steal Precious for a ransom,
but for love of her fair face. Do not be uneasy. I shall not
harm your beautiful daughter. She is safe in the care of a kind,
motherly woman, but she is also my prisoner, and will remain so
until she consents to become my bride. After she is married to me
you shall see her again, but never before; so you must be patient,
for she is a little obdurate now, but in the end I shall win her
consent."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter had no date or signature, but it was postmarked
Washington.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say it was an elopement?" cried Ethel, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
scornful triumph, but her father turned on her a lightning
glance of reproof, and cried sternly:</p>

<p>"Never dare, Ethel, to repeat that false word elopement
of your innocent sister again. You have just read
in this letter that it was an abduction, not an elopement.
So do not make another such mistake."</p>

<p>When Senator Winans left Precious standing like a vision
of beauty under a garlanded pillar to await his return,
he did not dream that the vulture of danger hovered near
his blue-eyed darling.</p>

<p>But burning eyes only a little distance away glared on
the girl with wolfish eagerness, and minute by minute
those small keen eyes grew fiercer with the fire of passion.</p>

<p>Precious, all unconscious of those burning eyes, stood
quietly watching the strangers that surrounded her, coming
and going in ceaseless ebb and flow like the waves of
the sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly those eyes came nearer, nearer, and burned on
the lovely face. Then a voice spoke in her ear:</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Miss Winans."</p>

<p>Precious started and looked at the speaker.</p>

<p>She recognized her drawing-master, Lindsey Warwick,
a young man she secretly disliked because she had a vague
suspicion that he was the writer of several mysterious love-letters
she had lately received.</p>

<p>She gave him a haughty nod, but she did not speak,
only stared in surprise at his elegant evening suit and the
rose in his buttonhole, that transformed him from the
poor drawing-master to the elegant man of fashion.</p>

<p>Lindsey Warwick was not at all abashed by her supercilious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
air. He seemed to be wildly agitated, his face
pale, his firm chin trembling with emotion. Bending
close to the girl's ear he whispered:</p>

<p>"Come! your father wishes me to take you to your
mother."</p>

<p>Something about him, his awe-struck tone, his agitation
frightened the girl. She gasped inquiringly:</p>

<p>"Mamma?"</p>

<p>And Lindsey Warwick answered unhesitatingly, though
his voice was hoarse and strange:</p>

<p>"Yes, poor child, your mother has just dropped dead
of heart-disease over yonder. Come," and he held out his
arm.</p>

<p>If she had uttered a cry the little scene might have attracted
attention from the vast crowd surging about, but
had he thrust a sword to the very hilt in her heart Precious
could not have fallen more silently or swiftly at his
feet. She just dropped down unconscious without moan
or cry&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>No one had observed anything strange, only one or
two looked around when he exclaimed, "My sister has
fainted!"</p>

<p>His ruse had succeeded admirably. Precious lay like a
dead girl at his feet, and there was no one to interfere.</p>

<p>The villain lifted the slender white form in his arms and
pushed through the crowd, trying to gain the door. People
made way when they saw his burden and heard him
mutter his formula, "My sister has fainted." But no one
displayed any special interest. Half a score of women had
fainted that night.</p>

<p>So Lindsey Warwick gained the outer air with his burden,
and soon finding a cab took her away.</p>

<p>It was a daring game that he had played, but he had
won.</p>

<p>The project had flashed into his mind when he saw her
alone and unguarded in the heedless crowd, and in the
desperation of a mad and hopeless love he had carried it
out. He knew that the chances were terribly against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
him, but he resolved to run the risk in hope of the
prize.</p>

<p>The cab took him and his captive to the very suburbs
of South Washington&mdash;to an old tumble-down red brick
house of two stories that stood alone in a large neglected
lot. There were but a few more houses in the square,
and those strictly of the shanty order.</p>

<p>Cabby held out his hand, remarking grumpily:</p>

<p>"Five dollars, you know, is legal fare for Inauguration
night."</p>

<p>"I'll make it ten for good luck, and you can go on a
big spree to-morrow," laughed Lindsey Warwick, handing
him a bill.</p>

<p>Cabby thanked the kind gentleman vociferously, but
he did not wait till the next day, but went on his orgies
at once, and wound up early next morning in the police
court, where he was sent to jail for ten days in default of
payment of his fine. He never saw the papers, never
knew of the sensation that had followed the simple fact
of his driving a young lady and gentleman home from the
Inauguration Ball. He did not dream that he had been
concerned in an abduction, or that Senator Winans would
have made him rich for life if he had given to him the
clew he possessed to his lost daughter.</p>

<p>Precious, the petted daughter of wealth and luxury all
her life, recovered her consciousness in the smallest, shabbiest,
most common-looking bedroom she had ever beheld.</p>

<p>A coarse woman of about fifty years was leaning over
her. She looked and smelled like a laundress.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and where am I?" quavered Precious.</p>

<p>A man came forward then, and at sight of him everything
came back to her memory. She lifted her head
from the coarse pillow with a shriek.</p>

<p>"Mamma! oh, darling mamma!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet. Your mother is all right, my dear," said
Warwick. "The story of her death was only a ruse to
make you faint, so that I could get you into my power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
I love you, so I brought you away to make you my prisoner
until you would consent to be my bride."</p>

<p>Precious sprang to her feet, her blue eyes blazing with
anger and scorn.</p>

<p>"You must be crazy! Why, my papa will kill you for
this!" she panted indignantly.</p>

<p>Lindsey Warwick laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear; he will not get the chance. He will
never know where you are until you marry me!"</p>

<p>She stamped her little foot with the pride of a
queen.</p>

<p>"Senator Winans' daughter marry you&mdash;a drawing-master!"
she cried, with increased indignation.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear. Pride can stoop sometimes.
Your mother was only a governess when she became the
senator's bride!"</p>

<p>She looked at him in amazement at his knowledge of
their family history, and answered proudly:</p>

<p>"My mother belonged to one of the proudest families
in the South. It was only the reverse of fortune
that placed her for a short time in a dependent position."</p>

<p>With a laugh he answered:</p>

<p>"Granted, but she was only a governess, and the
senator's daughter may stoop like her father to wed her
tutor."</p>

<p>"I hate you! I would not marry you if you were the
last man on earth! Release me at once, and let me go
home!" she cried imperiously.</p>

<p>"I will not. I love you to madness, and I have sworn
that I will make you my bride. I will keep you imprisoned
here until you consent."</p>

<p>"I will kill myself first."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that."</p>

<p>She looked at the coarse, frowzy-haired woman whose
greasy clothes smelled of soapsuds.</p>

<p>"Are you in this plot?" she asked disdainfully.</p>

<p>"He is my son, and has put you in my charge, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
have promised to keep you safe; that is all," was the careless
answer.</p>

<p>"But my father will search everywhere for me, and he
will punish you both when he finds me."</p>

<p>"He will not find you, for there will not be the slightest
clew for him to follow. This house is an old ruin,
and my mother lives here alone. I board in one of the
best neighborhoods in Washington, and I will never come
here to see you only late at night."</p>

<p>He made a motion to the old woman, and she immediately
retired from the room.</p>

<p>Then the dark, sneering face of the young man softened
with love and longing. He knelt at her feet, and
cried passionately:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, for I love you wildly, and I knew I could
never win you except by force. I have loved you madly
for months. I sent you the tenderest love-letters man
ever penned, but you did not reply to them. I looked at
you often with my heart in my eyes, but you averted your
face. Why were you so cold to me?"</p>

<p>"I despised you," answered Precious. "Only yesterday
I resolved to tell mamma that you were presuming on
your position to try to make love to me. I wish now
that I had told her. Then she would have had some suspicion
of the truth."</p>

<p>"She will think now that you have eloped with some
low-born lover!" he sneered, rising to his feet, for she
had drawn back from him in disdain. "But I will leave
you to rest now, my beautiful love, and my mother will
come and help you to retire. Fear nothing. You will
be kindly treated here, but you will never be restored to
your home until you consent to marry me&mdash;ay, until the
knot is tied. So think well of my proposal, for I will
make you a good husband. Good-night," and he bowed
and withdrew.</p>

<p>If the thought of her captivity had not been so dreadful,
Precious could have laughed at the man's presumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>To think that she, the daughter of an illustrious statesman,
should have such a lover as this&mdash;a drawing-master,
the son of a laundress! Well, papa would come to find
her very, very soon, and then he would punish the bold
villain for his presumption.</p>

<p>Lindsey Warwick had not counted on such determined
obstinacy as his lovely young captive displayed.</p>

<p>From first to last she refused to taste a morsel of food
beneath the roof of her jailer.</p>

<p>The keenness of her thirst made her accept water from
the woman, but that was all. Neither cajoleries, threats,
nor bribes could induce her to taste the food provided for
her, though it was of the best, with fruits and wines, and
even bon-bons to tempt her girlish appetite. Although
she was starving she pushed them aside with disdain, and
lay all day on the couch weeping forlornly, and calling
by turns on the names of her father, mother, and
sister.</p>

<p>Poor Precious! she had fully believed that her father
would find her in less than twenty-four hours, but the
long days wore away, and she gave herself up to despair.
Prayers, promises, pleadings, were of no avail with the
cruel old woman and her enamored son.</p>

<p>But at heart the old woman was uneasy and frightened
as the long days waned and the beautiful captive grew
paler and weaker day by day.</p>

<p>"She will die, Lindsey, for she has never tasted food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
since she came here, and that is a long week now. You
had better let her go. She will never marry you; she will
die first, as she said."</p>

<p>"Then she will be mine in death. I will bury her under
the cellar of this house, and no one will ever know the
secret of her fate."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder they did not suspect you," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I fancy the detectives did at first, but I was clever,
and threw them off the scent. In the first place, I went
as usual that day to give her her lesson in drawing.
When the servants told me she was missing I pretended
to be entirely in ignorance. Then I devoted myself to a
girl in my own rank, and contrived to make every one
think me engaged to her. That cleared me, you see."</p>

<p>"Better marry that girl, Lindsey. She might be happy
with you. T'other one wouldn't, even if you got her.
You're too poor; she couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>"But her father worships the ground she walks on; he
would give her a dowry if she married me."</p>

<p>"Better say he would disinherit her for such a marriage."</p>

<p>"Not if she could be brought to love me. He's a stickler
for love matches, I know. He married a governess
himself. No, mother, only let me get the little beauty to
marry me; and the senator would forgive us, and my fortune
would be made."</p>

<p>"Go upstairs and look at that poor girl a-dying, as
white as the wall, and not able to walk across the floor,
and maybe you'll change your mind," replied she cynically.</p>

<p>"By heaven! she shall eat!" he cried frantically. "I
will force her to swallow food at the point of a pistol."</p>

<p>"And drive her insane&mdash;yes, that's what you'll do!"</p>

<p>"Mother, you're a fool! Come along and help me,
and we'll pour some wine down her throat. She shall not
die. I love her too well. Life would be a desert without
her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>She followed him up the dark, rickety stairway, carrying
the lamp, for it was after dark, and presently unlocked
the door of the girl's prison.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he cried in horror.</p>

<p>Precious lay face downward on the floor, seemingly
lifeless.</p>

<p>"I told you so. She's dead! You've killed her!"
the woman muttered.</p>

<p>With a groan he flung himself on his knees and lifted
the silent form. The white face with its closed eyes fell
inertly across his arm. He bent his ear to her heart.</p>

<p>"No, no, she is not dead. Her heart beats faintly.
Quick! some wine in a spoon. Here, put it between
her lips. Let it trickle down her throat," and with wild
anxiety he held the still, white face up to the light.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meantime there were suspense and horror unutterable
in the senator's splendid mansion.</p>

<p>Since that bold and daring letter that had told them Precious
was in the power of a lover whose passion amounted
to insanity, no further clew had been found.</p>

<p>The most alert detectives of Washington and New
York were completely baffled, though neither time nor
money was spared in the quest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans had taken to her bed, a weak, nervous,
weeping woman, and the physician declared that she
would never rise from it again unless her daughter were
soon restored. Her husband looked like a man whose
mind might go wrong at any moment. Ethel, who had
been sullenly indifferent at first, and secretly exultant at
her sister's strait, began to get over her first anger, and
missing the sunshine from the house prayed God to pardon
her mad jealousy and restore her little sister to their
yearning hearts.</p>

<p>"And let Lord Chester love her if he will, for if he
can turn so easily from one to another he is not worth
the winning," she thought with bitter pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not see him much in those days, but she knew
that he was often with her father, and that he was eager
to join in and forward every plan for finding Precious.</p>

<p>"I am forgotten already; but let him go, he is nothing
to me," she said to herself with jealous pride, trying to
cheat her own aching heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly her brother, Earle, who had been abroad,
came home, and his grief and horror at the fate of Little
Blue Eyes, as he had loved to call his younger sister, were
most intense.</p>

<p>Ethel could not resist one bitter fling.</p>

<p>"Now that your idol is gone, perhaps you will be able
to remember sometimes that you have another sister," she
cried bitterly.</p>

<p>Earle, who was dark and handsome and impetuous,
like his father, turned on her a glance of displeasure.</p>

<p>"Ethel, how can you speak so? Have I ever forgotten
you? Did I not bring you from abroad more costly gifts
than I brought Precious?"</p>

<p>"Earle, forgive me; I was only jesting;" she cried
quickly. But the pretense did not deceive the brother,
who said to himself:</p>

<p>"Ethel is as foolishly jealous as ever. What a pity!"</p>

<p>But he put his arm around her and kissed the rosy
cheek.</p>

<p>"You are more beautiful than ever, dear, and I have
heard it whispered that you will some day be&mdash;Lady
Chester," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me of Lord Chester. I hate him!"
cried Ethel, and fled, sobbing wildly, to her own room.</p>

<p>She might weep all she would over her false lover now,
and they would only think it was grief for her sister.
Her maid thought so when she came into the room with
tearful eyes and said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, miss, if you'd take my advice you'd go to see a
fortune-teller about Miss Precious. I know one in South
Washington almost out in the country, and she tells
very true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Hetty; they have no knowledge of the future&mdash;no
more than we have."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Miss Ethel, she told me wonderful things,
and true as gospel, every word. I do believe as sure as
my name's Hetty Wilkins that she could give you a clew
to your sister's whereabouts. She's a clairvoyant, and
charges a dollar for each person. Them clairvoyants
always tells true, they say. Now, if you would like to
slip out this afternoon for a walk, I'd go with you, for it's
a lonesome neighborhood, and not safe for a lady like
you alone."</p>

<p>"What is the address, did you say, Hetty?" inquired
Ethel eagerly.</p>

<p>The woman fumbled in her pocketbook and brought
out a crumpled bit of paper that she spread before Ethel's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll go with you to-morrow; I've another
engagement for this afternoon to go walking with Miss
Miller," Ethel said carelessly, and when Hetty saw her going
out an hour later in a simple tailor-made suit and
thick veil, she thought her young lady was going to keep
her engagement, and sighed regretfully at Ethel's lack
of faith in the wonderful clairvoyant seeress.</p>

<p>But Ethel knew how to keep her own secrets. She was
on her way to the woman now.</p>

<p>She was not afraid, in spite of what Hetty had told
her, for she had her sister's magnificent great mastiff along
for protection&mdash;Kay, his young mistress insisted on calling
him, because a beautiful young lady at the White
House had one of that name.</p>

<p>It was a dreary March afternoon with a high wind and
sunless sky, and Ethel had a long walk before her, but
she preferred it to riding. She was an excellent pedestrian.</p>

<p>She reached the lonely old tumble-down brick house,
and after knocking several times was admitted by a frowzy
looking woman, who said that she was a fortune-teller.</p>

<p>"I have a lover, but I fear I have lost his love. I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to know if I shall ever marry him," faltered Ethel, putting
some money in the outstretched palm.</p>

<p>"I can tell you about him, miss, but you must quiet
that dog first. He is running and barking in the hall
like a crazy thing, with his nose on the floor. What ails
him?" uneasily.</p>

<p>Ethel opened the door and after some difficulty induced
Kay to enter.</p>

<p>"He will be quiet now," she said, but Kay belied her
words. The beautiful great fellow ran whining about the
room, giving every symptom of excitement and interest.
Suddenly he dipped his muzzle into a basket of trash in
one corner and emitted a prolonged and dismal howl as
he trotted back to Ethel.</p>

<p>Turning in surprise she saw in his mouth a long white
kid glove, very tiny, and with golden buttons.</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven! my little sister's glove!" she cried.</p>

<p>The fortune-teller, who was no other than Mrs. Warwick,
the laundress, became terribly agitated at the finding
of the glove, and the excited shriek of Ethel.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! my sister's glove!" shrieked the girl, and
the woman cowered before her, and turned ashy pale.</p>

<p>The immense mastiff permitted Ethel to take the little
white glove from his mouth, but he pressed close to her
side with his great fore-paws in her lap, and fixing his big
intelligent eyes on her face with an imploring expression,
kept on yelping and whining in a dismal strain that was
almost terrifying.</p>

<p>Kay had loved his fair young mistress with intense
canine devotion, and as soon as he entered the old house
his keenness of scent had made him acquainted with her
presence there. He was following up the trail with
blended joy and perplexity, when Ethel had called him
into the room, where he had at once renewed his investigations,
with the result that he had found the glove.</p>

<p>It was hers, Kay knew it, and with almost human
excitement he carried it to Ethel, while his dismal yelps
said as plain as words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"My darling little mistress is somewhere near to us, but
I cannot find her. Help me! oh, help me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Warwick stared at both in horror, for the fatal
truth dawned on her mind. This girl was the sister of the
captive upstairs, and the faithful dog had penetrated the
mystery.</p>

<p>While she was collecting her scattered self-possession
Ethel turned to her, exclaiming agitatedly:</p>

<p>"My sister is in this house, a prisoner! Lead me to her
at once."</p>

<p>The expression of fear on Mrs. Warwick's face changed
to one of cunning, and she cried sullenly:</p>

<p>"Lady, I don't know what you mean! What would your
sister be doing in this old house, where nobody lives but
me? That glove was left here a week ago by a beautiful
young lady that wanted her fortune told. I kept it,
a-thinking she'd likely come back for it, but she never
did."</p>

<p>"The girl was my sister. Did she come alone?" asked
Ethel, fancying that perhaps her maid had told Precious
about the fortune-teller, too. It made the woman's story
sound plausible.</p>

<p>"That dog makes me nervous. But get him to stop his
racket, and I'll tell you all about the girl."</p>

<p>Ethel pressed Kay's head down upon her knee, and
soothed him until his sharp, impatient yelps subsided into
low, dismal whining, and then the woman said:</p>

<p>"It was Inauguration night, about midnight, I guess,
that I was aroused by a couple, a pretty, blue-eyed girl in
white, with long yellow curls, and a handsome young man.
They told me they had run away from the ball to get
married, and the girl was afraid of her father, and wanted
me to tell her if he would ever forgive her for doing it.
It seemed as how he was a swell, and rich, but her young
man was poor, and worked for a living. I read the cards
for them, and told them to go ahead, that the old man
would come round and take them home to live in the grand
mansion. The girl laughed for joy, and the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
paid me a double fee, then they went away in their carriage,
and presently I found the girl's glove on the floor
where she had dropped it."</p>

<p>Her story had a plausible sound, but Ethel looked at
her suspiciously, and said:</p>

<p>"The girl's description answers to that of my sister,
Precious Winans, who was abducted from the Inauguration
Ball; but there is something strange about your story,
for my sister was not willing to marry the man. I'm certain
of that."</p>

<p>"Then it couldn't be the same young lady, for the one
I saw here was desperate fond of her young man, I'm
sure," returned the woman maliciously, hoping that
this falsehood would help her son's cause with the
senator.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said Ethel, with a perplexed air,
for she did not believe in her heart that Precious was in
love with anybody. She rose abruptly, restraining Kay
by a hand on his silver collar. "I will take the glove to
papa and tell him what you have told me. Perhaps it
may give him a clew."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, miss, I haven't told your fortune yet. Just
stay a little longer, and keep that brute quiet, and I'll go
into a trance, and tell you all you want to know."</p>

<p>Ethel paused irresolute. She did not really have much
faith in the old woman's powers of divination, but she was
curious, and&mdash;"the woman who hesitates is lost."</p>

<p>The fortune-teller threw herself into a chair, leaned her
head back, closed her eyes, and feigned sleep.</p>

<p>Ethel, with her hand on Kay's collar, waited nervously.</p>

<p>Soon the woman began to mutter, like one asleep.</p>

<p>And as she was very angry at Ethel for coming there
and getting her into what she foresaw would be a very bad
scrape, she determined to give the young lady a very grewsome
fortune. She accordingly began:</p>

<p>"You have a rich and handsome lover, and every girl
in Washington has envied you, but now they laugh in
derision."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel started violently, her dark eyes flashing luridly.</p>

<p>"They laugh," continued the pretended clairvoyant,
"because another girl has cut you out with your grand
lover. He has almost forgotten you already, and worships
the blue eyes and golden hair of his new love."</p>

<p>She heard a repressed gasp of agony that assured her
that the chance shot had hit the mark, but her malice was
not satiated yet, and she continued solemnly and
dreamily:</p>

<p>"You will have a bad, black, bitter future. Your
jealous hate of your successful rival will cause you to commit
a crime. I cannot tell you for certain whether you
will be sent to prison or hung for it, for I cannot clearly
read the jurors' minds; besides, much will depend on the
great influence of your powerful relations, so I don't know
exactly how much punishment you will get, but it is
written in the book of fate that you will sin and you will
suffer."</p>

<p>It was the merest malicious jargon, guess-work, based
on Ethel's first statement that she had lost her lover's
heart, but it struck home to Ethel's proud, passionate
heart with the awful certainty of prophecy. She trembled
with terror, and the cold dew of fear started out on her
brow, beneath the dark wavy tresses of her rich hair.
With an effort she shook the woman's shoulder loathingly.</p>

<p>"Wake up! I don't want to hear any more of your
dismal stuff! I'm going," she cried imperiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warwick shuddered, gasped, and seemed to come
out of a deep sleep. Her guest was already going through
the doorway into the hall.</p>

<p>Just then Kay broke from Ethel's grasp, and bounded up
the rickety stairs to the narrow passageway above. They
heard him, reared up on his hind feet, beating with his
fore-paws on a door, and barking furiously.</p>

<p>"Call your dog down, or I will kill him!" shrieked the
woman.</p>

<p>"You will not dare to do it. Papa brought him from
Europe for my sister, and he cost several hundred dollars,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
answered Ethel quickly, but she stood at the foot of the
stairway and called the mastiff repeatedly, first persuasively,
then authoritatively.</p>

<p>But one tone had no more effect than the other.</p>

<p>Kay continued his vociferous barking, and the sound of
his huge body as he hurled it against the resisting door
echoed through the house.</p>

<p>"The brute is devilish! If I had a pistol I'd shoot him,
even if he cost ten thousand dollars!" vowed the irate
fortune-teller.</p>

<p>"I will go and bring him down," cried Ethel, but the
woman pushed her away.</p>

<p>"No, no! you must not go up there! He is only after
my big cat! I will go myself, and drive him down!"</p>

<p>"But you must not strike him. Precious never allowed
any one to strike him," Ethel called anxiously.</p>

<p>The woman did not answer; she rushed on, and caught
up a stick in the hall. Furious with anger she brought
it down on Kay's back.</p>

<p>There was a savage howl of pain and fury.</p>

<p>The petted mastiff that had never felt the weight of a
blow in his life, turned glaring red eyes on his assailant,
and sprang at her ferociously.</p>

<p>In a minute she was down under the huge paws.</p>

<p>Ethel heard the blow, the savage howl of the startled
dog, the fall of the woman's body on the floor, borne down
by Kay's strong paws, then strangling shrieks:</p>

<p>"Help! Help! He will kill me!"</p>

<p>The girl bounded up the stairs and saw the infuriated
Kay at the throat of the prostrate woman.</p>

<p>With a cry of horror Ethel caught his collar in both
hands, trying to drag him off.</p>

<p>But Kay resisted all the efforts of her puny strength,
and the contest must have ended in a tragedy but for a
sudden happening.</p>

<p>From within the closed and locked door where Kay had
been struggling to effect an entrance sounded a low, clear,
eager voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kay! Kay! come to Precious!"</p>

<p>The woman on the floor was kicking, struggling, shrieking,
and the dog, with his paws on her breast had his fangs
at her throat, but at that sweet, clear voice everything
changed on the instant.</p>

<p>The dog, with his jaws wide open, emitted a howl of
savage joy, and leaped upward to the height of a man,
then turned from the woman and back to the door. His
victim scrambled to her feet, her garments hanging in
tatters, her face ashy pale and absolutely fiendish, but
before she could utter a word she saw Ethel come up to
her with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>The girl cried sternly:</p>

<p>"My sister is in that room. Open the door this instant,
I command you."</p>

<p>"I will not obey you!"</p>

<p>"You shall!"</p>

<p>"I will not!"</p>

<p>Ethel's face was corpse-like in its pallor, her black eyes
glowed with light.</p>

<p>"Kay!" she called, in a low, menacing voice, and the
woman shuddered. At the same time a voice in the locked
room called plaintively:</p>

<p>"Ethel! Ethel! darling sister Ethel!"</p>

<p>"That is my sister's voice," cried Ethel wildly.
"Woman, your defiance drives me mad! If you do not
instantly open that door and release Precious I shall set
the mastiff on you. He will tear you limb from limb!"</p>

<p>"I'll murder you first!" growled the woman, edging
toward the club on the floor.</p>

<p>"Kay will protect me," the girl answered dauntlessly.
"Once more, will you open the door? No? Kay!"</p>

<p>The mastiff, leaping and yelping at the door, turned his
head, and the woman's defiance all fled.</p>

<p>"Take him away; let me get at the door, and I'll open
it. The key's in my pocket," she growled.</p>

<p>Ethel drew Kay away and talked to him coaxingly while
Mrs. Warwick pushed the key in the lock, turned it, and
opened the door a little way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go in now, you and the dog," she cried. "The girl's
bed-rid, and can't come out to you, and you can't leave
that devil outside to devour me."</p>

<p>Ethel was so excited that she did not dream of danger
or treachery to herself. She and Kay pushed past the
woman, and entered the room. That instant the door
was banged and locked on the outside.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Ethel heard the key click in the lock, but in the excitement
of finding her sister she attached no significance to
the fact.</p>

<p>She turned eagerly to the bed where lay a slender form
clothed in a cheap blue wrapper of eider-down, over which
swept a torrent of curling hair like sunshine.</p>

<p>But, oh, that face! Could it be Precious, the laughing,
dimple-faced darling, with her cheeks like rose-leaves, her
ripe red lips, her glorious eyes like blue pansies in the
sunshine?</p>

<p>That wan little face on the coarse pillow was all thin and
pale, with great shadows under the hollow eyes that were
dim and faded from constant weeping. The little white
hands were wasted so that the bewitching dimples were
gone from the knuckles and the blue veins showed with
painful clearness through the transparent skin.</p>

<p>At that piteous sight all the jealous hardness went out
of Ethel's heart. She sprang with open arms to Precious,
and clasped her to her breast, while Kay hovered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
them in delight, licking the little feeble hands of his
darling young mistress.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ethel, why didn't you come sooner? Where is
papa? Why didn't he come with you? I shall die, and
never see him any more," sobbed Precious plaintively.</p>

<p>"Die! Oh, no, my darling!" soothed Ethel, but she
was startled by the words and the weakness and pallor of
her sister.</p>

<p>"Precious, what has changed you so? Have you been
ill?" she exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am starving. I have never tasted food since the night
I was kidnaped from the ball," answered Precious, in her
faint, weak, hollow voice.</p>

<p>Ethel could scarcely credit the words, for a small stand
near the bed was heaped high with edibles, fruits, and
wines.</p>

<p>But Precious explained that she had determined to
starve herself to death unless she was released from the
power of the hated Lindsey Warwick.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I fainted from weakness when I tried to
walk across the floor, and those two wretches came in and
poured wine down my throat while I was too weak to
resist, and again this morning she forced wine between my
lips, and made me live a little longer, or else I think I
should be dead already," and here Precious paused and
gasped, too weak to continue.</p>

<p>"But you must eat and drink now, for I shall want you
to go home with me," said Ethel tenderly, and she fed
Precious like a little child, the poor girl taking food
readily, for the pangs of hunger had been terrible to bear.</p>

<p>She ate and drank with grateful eagerness, and Ethel
watched her with moist, dark eyes, and thought:</p>

<p>"Poor child, if I had stayed away a little longer she
would have been dead; my little sister, that I have hated
and envied in my evil moments, would never have crossed
my path again, and I should not lose my lover as I shall
surely do when once he sees Precious."</p>

<p>Was she glad or sorry that she had come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>She was glad!</p>

<p>It was one of the moments when good triumphed over
evil in the complex nature of Ethel Winans.</p>

<p>"It was Heaven that sent me here to rescue Precious,"
she thought happily, and for awhile Lord Chester was
forgotten while the sisters made mutual explanations.</p>

<p>"So it was Lindsey Warwick, after all. The detectives
suspected him at first, but he hoodwinked them very
cleverly," said Ethel.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a fiend!" cried Precious shudderingly.</p>

<p>"Then you could never accept him as a lover?" Ethel
asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, never, never! He is very repulsive to me, with
his keen little eyes, and his thick lips, and his perpetual
smirk. If I ever have a lover I must have a grand, handsome
one, as noble as papa, or perhaps like your lover,
Ethel&mdash;I do not know his name, but I saw him at the ball
with you, and I thought he was splendid. Well, when I
have a real lover he must be like that, Ethel!" cried
Precious innocently.</p>

<p>A shadow gleamed over Ethel's dusky beauty, and she
thought:</p>

<p>"They are mutually attracted to each other. It is
fate."</p>

<p>But she said carelessly:</p>

<p>"You are too young to dream of lovers yet, my dear,
and when you get safe home again you must devote yourself
to your studies, and not tease about going to balls.
It was your willfulness about the Inauguration Ball that
brought you into this trouble."</p>

<p>"And papa will put that villain into prison for this, I
know," cried Precious, her voice a little stronger from the
food and wine she had taken. Then she hugged Kay
around his neck and kissed the top of his head.</p>

<p>"Darling old fellow, if it had not been for you Ethel
would have come and gone without finding me. Oh, how
shall I ever pay you for this? You shall have a golden
collar with your name set in rubies&mdash;yes, you shall. Papa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
will buy it for you, I know, to pay you for saving his
pet."</p>

<p>Kay showed as much boisterous delight as if he understood
every word, and kept licking her little hands with
joy unutterable.</p>

<p>"And now, dear, we must get out of this place, and go
home if you think you are ready," smiled Ethel.</p>

<p>"Ready!" cried Precious gayly. "Well, I know I am
very weak from my long fast, but joy makes me feel like
a new girl. I have nothing to wear home but this blue
wrapper over my ball dress, but no matter&mdash;let us start at
once. If I am too weak to walk I can crawl there, or
perhaps Kay will let me ride on his back," patting him
tenderly.</p>

<p>Ethel turned the handle of the door, but it resisted her
efforts, and she recoiled with a low cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, I had forgotten! I heard that old hag
lock the door on the outside as I entered. I am a prisoner
too. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>The tears rushed into her sister's blue eyes.</p>

<p>"There is no use in screaming, for I cried that day and
night until I was hoarse as a raven, but no one ever seemed
to hear me. And the only window is nailed down, you
see. But, oh, Ethel, they will miss you at home and
come here to look for you presently, won't they dear?"</p>

<p>"I did not tell them I was coming here. I felt ashamed
of going to see a fortune-teller to find out about you. They
would have laughed at me. I let my maid think that I
was going to see a friend. Oh, what shall I do? Why did
I ever come here?" wept Ethel, wringing her hands in
terror, and forgetting that she had told herself just now
that God himself had sent her to the aid of Precious.</p>

<p>She shrieked aloud; she tore at the door with frantic
hands.</p>

<p>"It will soon be night, and they will wonder what
has become of me. This double sorrow will drive our
poor mother mad. Oh, what shall I do?" she cried again
in agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we could only get that window open," cried
Precious eagerly. "But I have tried it every day, and
my hands bled, but the nails would not come out. But if
we could only open it, Ethel, we could plait a rope of the
bedclothes, and get out."</p>

<p>Kay looked from one to the other, whining in unison
with their grief.</p>

<p>Ethel turned a flashing glance on the window, then
caught up a thick wash pitcher of heavy iron-stone ware.
She poured the water out, and rushed at the window, dealing
blow after blow on the panes. Joy! the thin glass and
slight framework gave way before her furious onslaught.
Then she attacked the shutters with the same signal success.
They tumbled from their fastenings down to the
ground two stories below. The sash was all gone, too,
and the fresh outer air rushed into their faces&mdash;fresh, but
full of the fog and damp of early twilight.</p>

<p>"Quick! now the bedclothes! We will sit at the window
while we tear them in strips, and if we see any one passing
we will scream to them for help," cried Ethel bravely,
though her lovely hands were torn and bleeding from fragments
of flying glass. They set to work, but Precious was
so weak from her long fast that she could not help much.
The little hands were strengthless and nerveless.</p>

<p>"She must have heard you breaking in the window, and
she will come up here presently and kill us," she shuddered,
with terrified eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't be a coward, Precious. I think the old wretch
has very likely run off to tell her son what has happened,
and we must get away before they come back, for, of
course, he will be very angry, and, as you suggested, he
may kill us," answered Ethel, working away in a perfect
frenzy of fear and excitement.</p>

<p>But Precious was very weak and nervous; she could not
bear the strain of this horrible dread, following on the
hope of a few minutes ago. She dropped back quietly in
her chair and fainted.</p>

<p>Ethel would not relax her frantic labor to resuscitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
her, but Kay fell to licking the white face with such a
rough, energetic tongue that presently Precious sighed and
revived, pushing him down with feeble hands.</p>

<p>"Down, sir! down! You must not be so impudent," she
sighed faintly.</p>

<p>"Come, Precious, our rope is done. Can you help me
to fasten it to the leg of the bed? Then we will throw it
from the window. I will slide down first, and you will
follow. I will catch you at the bottom if you fall. And
Kay can jump out after us. Oh, Heaven, what is that?"</p>

<p>She might well exclaim, for at that moment the wall at
the opposite side of the room was suddenly divided by a
burst of smoke and flame that lighted up the gloom with a
lurid glare.</p>

<p>They had thought it was the wind, the strange, crackling
noises they had faintly heard for some time, but now
they understood the full horror of their situation.</p>

<p>The old house was in flames&mdash;fired doubtless by the
fiendish old hag who had thus wreaked her vengeance and
fled, leaving them to their fate.</p>

<p>It was a moment of the most sublime horror, the most
deadly peril.</p>

<p>The two girls gazed at each other with horror-stricken
faces, and the mastiff lifted up his voice in a prolonged
and dismal howl like a banshee.</p>

<p>"We are trapped," cried Ethel wildly. "She has fired
the house and gone. But we shall escape. Come, dear."
She drew Precious to the window, and climbed upon the
sill. "I will go first; you follow."</p>

<p>She grasped the rope, and swung outward, her heart
beating wildly, her eyes watching the face of Precious as
it leaned forward against the awful background of smoke
and flame. The small pale face, like a snowdrop, the
luminous blue eyes, the aureole of golden hair, made
Precious look angelic.</p>

<p>Ethel felt herself rushing through the cold March air,
and&mdash;suddenly she shot down wildly, and fell on the wet
ground where the thick spongy turf broke the severity
of the fall. Safe!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>But an awful cry escaped her lips.</p>

<p>The plaited rope had proved treacherous, and broken off
midway, dangling its useless length about a yard below the
window sill, above which that beautiful white face looked
down in a frenzy of despair.</p>

<p>Ethel staggered to her feet; she flung out her arms, she
shrieked:</p>

<p>"Come, darling, climb out upon the rope, and drop.
I will catch you&mdash;I will break the fall."</p>

<p>But Precious scarcely heard. Her senses had deserted
her at sight of the broken rope. Ethel saw the dilated
blue eyes close again, saw her sister fall backward into the
blinding smoke, heard the frenzied yelp of Kay as he
sprang upon the window sill, and felt that no earthly
power could save her doomed sister now.</p>

<p>She held out her arms to Kay, and shrieked wildly:</p>

<p>"Come to me, Kay, come!"</p>

<p>But the poor beast gave a desolate howl, and sprang
back into the room where Precious lay unconscious. Then
a great black volume of smoke poured through the window,
and from the front of the house Ethel saw the red glaring
flame shoot quickly.</p>

<p>"The front of the house is all in flames. No one can
save my sister now," she thought. Then something
seemed to say in her heart:</p>

<p>"You are to blame. You should have sent her down the
rope first. She was so light and small it would have carried
her safely, and both would have been saved."</p>

<p>It made her angry, that still small voice of conscience,
for she knew that it was a selfish anxiety over her own
safety that made her descend first. Moving away she
muttered:</p>

<p>"Why should I run the risk of my life for her? I tried
to save her, and if she had not been so cowardly I would
have succeeded. She will perish, but it is not my
fault."</p>

<p>Why did she not run and spread the alarm? Some man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
might be found who would be brave enough to scale the
window and bring out the unconscious girl.</p>

<p>But Ethel moved away, going backward, watching with
fascinated eyes the burning building, her sister's funeral
pyre.</p>

<p>Shrieks began to fill the air from the occupants of the
shanties around, just discovering the fire. A crowd began
to gather. Why did not the retreating girl pray the
people to rescue her sister?</p>

<p>A tempting devil had recalled to her mind her sister's
words of admiration for Lord Chester a little while ago&mdash;her
longing for just such a splendid lover.</p>

<p>"Precious dead he would be yours; living she would
win him from you," whispered the tempter, and she
turned away muttering, "It is too late. No one could
save her now."</p>

<p>A crowd soon collected and the fire engines quickly
came upon the scene.</p>

<p>Streams of water began to play on the burning house,
but to no avail. The fire had made too much headway to
be checked now. The old ramshackle building was
doomed. In the large crowd that had collected were two
very elegant-looking young men&mdash;Earle Winans and Lord
Chester.</p>

<p>The two young men, although acquainted but a few
days, had become fast friends.</p>

<p>It was the nobleman's deep solicitude over the fate of
Precious that had first drawn Earle toward him. Lord
Chester's services were always ready in any new plan for
finding Precious; he was as eager as Earle himself in the
search.</p>

<p>The Winans family believed that all this zeal was for
the sake of Ethel, whom the nobleman had seemed to
admire so much that gossip said he would certainly make
her Lady Chester at no distant date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>So Earle had taken the handsome young nobleman
warmly into his heart and confidence.</p>

<p>They had been walking together that chilly afternoon,
several blocks away from the place, when the light of the
burning building drew them to follow the crowd to the
spot.</p>

<p>They arrived but a few moments after Ethel had turned
away from the dreadful scene, hardening her jealous heart
against the voice of accusing conscience, and answering
to its reproaches: "I tried to save her, and it was through
her own cowardice she perished."</p>

<p>When her brother and Lord Chester came on the scene
they heard some one saying:</p>

<p>"There is a dog shut up in that house. Hear his
frightful baying!"</p>

<p>They could hear it distinctly, the prolonged mournful
howls, and it seemed as if the sounds came from an open
window.</p>

<p>"The window is open. Why don't the foolish animal
come out?" cried Earle Winans, and just then the streams
of water playing on the side of the wall cleared away the
smoke a little, and the animal was seen a moment dimly,
then with another howl he fell back into the room.</p>

<p>"He is bewildered and afraid to jump," cried a fireman,
as poor Kay's dismal wails came distinctly to the ears of
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is some person in the room, and he is
too faithful to desert his post. Dogs are often more
faithful than friends. Put up a ladder, and I will go and
see," exclaimed Lord Chester suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, no! you must not risk your life for a dog, even a
faithful one," cried Earle, trying to hold his friend back,
for the situation was very perilous.</p>

<p>"No, no! I must save that poor dog!" Lord Chester
cried, breaking loose and ascending the ladder, while the
shouts of the tumultuous crowd rang to heaven.</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, through the blinding smoke and heat
and threatening flame he went, and presently his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
rose above the sill of the open window and he peered into
the room, which seemed full of black smoke and leaping
flames.</p>

<p>He put out his hand and it touched a big tawny head.</p>

<p>"Come, good fellow, come," he cried, and tried to drag
him out.</p>

<p>Then he made a startling discovery.</p>

<p>The faithful mastiff had dragged an unconscious human
being to the window with his teeth, and was holding
her up by a mass of golden hair in a vain effort to get her
up to the sill, where she might be seen and rescued by
the crowd.</p>

<p>Through the falling twilight of the bleak March day
Ethel Winans sped away like a guilty creature, nor paused
until she reached her home.</p>

<p>Entering by a private door she gained her own room
unobserved and hastened to bathe her face and hands and
rearrange her disordered tresses.</p>

<p>Then she summoned Hetty, and the maid stared in
surprise at her corpse-like pallor and heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel, you look awful! Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"I am tired to death," sighed Ethel. "I have had such
a long, weary chase after Kay! Oh, Hetty, I have lost
him, but you must never, never tell, for papa would
never forgive me if he knew. He ran off with some other
dogs in a park, and though I ran and ran I could not get
him back."</p>

<p>"You ought not to worry so about the dog, Miss Ethel.
Lordy, he'll be sure to find his way back home," declared
the maid cheerfully.</p>

<p>Ethel looked on the verge of tears. She half sobbed:</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I hope he will, for Precious loved
him so dearly, and papa will be so sorry to find him gone,
and he will be so angry with me for taking him out.
Please don't say anything about it to any one, Hetty,
and you may have that coral bracelet of mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Miss Ethel, and of course it's not
my business to find out that Kay is missing. So now it's
time to dress for dinner, if you please. What dress will
you wear, Miss Ethel? That new gold-colored silk with
the black lace draperies, or something plainer? There's
no one to dinner but the two gentlemen of the family.
Your mamma is not well enough to dine."</p>

<p>"Poor mamma! But, Hetty, I am too tired to dress
and dine to-night. I think I will send down excuses and
retire. My head is throbbing with pain. I believe I
should like a sedative."</p>

<p>Hetty brought the sedative and helped her to bed, saying
as she tucked in the silken coverlet:</p>

<p>"Miss Miller called for you this afternoon, and I told
her you had gone to keep an engagement with her. She
said there must be some mistake; she hadn't seen you.
I thought to myself that maybe you changed your mind
and went to the old clairvoyant after all."</p>

<p>"I didn't have time to go anywhere after I lost Kay
and had that long chase after him, so I hurried home,"
Ethel answered evasively. Then she nestled her head in
the pillow and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, Hetty, I don't need you any longer. You can
go and tell mamma I was so weary from my long walk
that I retired."</p>

<p>Hetty dimmed the light and went out, but she thought
sagely:</p>

<p>"Miss Ethel fibbed when she said she hadn't been anywhere.
I'll bet a dime she's been to the old fortune-teller,
and she told her something she didn't like and
she's gone to bed to cry over it."</p>

<p>Ah, Hetty, your young mistress had more to grieve over
than you guessed, and the pillow of down might have
been full of thorns for all the rest she found that night.</p>

<p>For, shut her eyes as she might, there was one vision
always before them&mdash;a wan little face like a snowdrop,
luminous blue eyes, golden hair like an aureole of light;
then it would fade and fall away into a cloud of smoke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
flame, only to reappear again, until Ethel writhed in
anguish and sobbed:</p>

<p>"It was not my fault. I could have saved her if she
had not fainted. But no one must ever know I was there.
They would blame me for her awful death."</p>

<p>She sat up in bed staring with gloomy eyes and writhing
hands, trying to put from her the horror of her sister's
death and to think what life would be like now when there
was no pretty, willful Precious any more to envy for her
fatal power of winning hearts.</p>

<p>"They must learn to love me now, papa, mamma, Earle
and&mdash;Lord Chester, for his heart will turn back to me
when there is no witching Precious to distract his thoughts.
They loved her too well and fate has punished them by
taking their idol away. It is my turn now," she thought
with a bitter triumph.</p>

<p>Ah, Ethel, could the straining gaze of those somber
eyes have pierced the shadows of the gloomy twilight they
would have beheld a sight to blast them with its surprise.</p>

<p>Down the ladder came Lord Chester bearing the unconscious
form of golden-haired Precious, whom Ethel had
forsaken, and who never would have been saved but for the
devotion of the faithful mastiff, noble Kay.</p>

<p>The shouts that rose from the crowd, as Lord Chester
came down with the girl in his arms and the brave mastiff
leaped from the window might almost have reached
Ethel's ears, they were so loud and ringing.</p>

<p>Lord Chester was so blind and dizzy from the heat and
smoke that as soon as his burden was drawn from his
arms he sank exhausted to the ground.</p>

<p>The next instant the roof of the building fell in, leaving
only the outer walls standing. Lord Chester had
saved a life that but for his bravery must have perished
in the raging flames.</p>

<p>Earle Winans pressed forward to his friend's assistance
with a pang of keen remorse as he remembered how he
had tried to restrain his friend from that perilous undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"How little I dreamed that a human being was in
deadly peril within the house," he thought as he gazed
curiously at the girl his friend had rescued from such an
awful fate.</p>

<p>His dark eyes noted the golden hair all tossed and
tangled in a curly mass, the closed eyes, the waxen fair
face in its pallid beauty. Then a loud cry burst from his
lips:</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! it is my missing sister&mdash;little Precious!"</p>

<p>And he reeled and would have fallen but for the restraining
arm of a stranger.</p>

<p>Water was poured on his face and he quickly revived
from his momentary faintness.</p>

<p>He knelt by the silent form of the unconscious girl, crying
in anguish:</p>

<p>"It is Precious! my little sister! Oh, do not tell me
she is dead."</p>

<p>A physician pushed through the crowd and made a
hasty examination. His face was very grave.</p>

<p>"She is not dead, but her unconsciousness is very deep,"
he said. "If it is a simple swoon she may revive, but if
asphyxiated by the smoke and heat, as I greatly fear, she
will very likely soon expire."</p>

<p>Lord Chester, recovering from his momentary exhaustion,
heard their words and looked with a bitter heart-pang
at the face of Precious. Never before had he gazed at
that face, yet there came a swift despair at thought of
her death&mdash;a swift despair that blotted out all memory of
Ethel's sparkling beauty that such a little while ago had
charmed him so.</p>

<p>"We must have a carriage and take her home," cried
Earle huskily, then wrung his friend's hand and thanked
him for the rescue of his sister.</p>

<p>"From this hour you are dear to me as a brother,"
he cried with deep emotion.</p>

<p>So it happened that while Ethel sat up in bed staring
with wild eyes into a possible future that held no lovely
sister for a rival, a carriage was pausing at the door that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
held Earle Winans, his unconscious sister, and a physician,
and presently there came ringing to Ethel's ear the long
cry of anguish wrung from a mother's heart while bending
over her dead.</p>

<p>Ethel started and listened in terror. What did it
mean, that long, low cry of grief in her mother's voice?</p>

<p>Then Hetty Wilkins rushed in, pale and tearful, crying
out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel, such dreadful news! They have
bought Miss Precious home dead."</p>

<p>But from behind her came Earle Winans, and he exclaimed
angrily:</p>

<p>"Hetty, you are a cruel girl to frighten Ethel so. You
had no business to come to her with such news. My
mother sent me to break it to her gently. Ethel, dear,
do not sob so bitterly. We have brought Precious home,
but a little life lingers still and we hope she may not die."</p>

<p>Ethel had dropped her face in her hands. When her
brother lifted it he was startled at its expression, the
ghastly face, the eyes wide and dark with horror.</p>

<p>He scolded Hetty roundly for her rashness in blurting
out the news to his sister, and the girl stood aside sulkily
at his reproof.</p>

<p>"Never mind Hetty; she meant no harm, Earle; but
tell me all about it. Where did you find Precious?"
gasped Ethel, clinging to him in wild excitement.</p>

<p>And holding her head against his arm and smoothing
the dark waves of her hair with a loving hand Earle told
the story as far as he knew it&mdash;the story of his young
sister's rescue by Arthur, Lord Chester.</p>

<p>Kay, the splendid mastiff, came in for a share of praise
too, and Hetty, the maid, listened intently to it all and
nodded excitedly when Earle said:</p>

<p>"The greatest wonder of all is how Kay came to be
there; but of course if Precious revives she can explain all
that."</p>

<p>He felt Ethel shuddering against his arm, and Hetty
saw how she trembled, and said to herself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think Miss Ethel could explain it too, if she would,
and if she don't speak I shall begin to think she has some
strange secret worth more than the gift of a bracelet."</p>

<p>"I must go back to my mother now, for our father is
too wretched himself to comfort her. Ethel, try to come
down if you can," he said, as he left the room.</p>

<p>Ethel dragged herself out of bed, moaning:</p>

<p>"You must dress me, Hetty, and let me go to my poor
sister."</p>

<p>Hetty brought her slippers and a pretty wrapper, and
while she was putting them on she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a brave young man Lord Chester must be!"</p>

<p>Ethel's heart gave a fierce throb of mingled pride and pain.</p>

<p>"And," pursued the loquacious maid, "he is the rich
lord that they all say you are going to marry, isn't he,
Miss Ethel?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ethel carelessly, then added:</p>

<p>"But I don't think I shall accept him."</p>

<p>She turned away from the maid as she spoke and went
from her own apartments toward those of Precious,
nearer to her mother.</p>

<p>She opened the door very softly and glided in.</p>

<p>They were all there, her father, mother, brother, and
the physician.</p>

<p>Precious lay on her bed, white as a lily, but breathing
faintly. She had revived from her swoon, but she had
not yet spoken. Her half-open blue eyes seemed to know
that they were all there, but she was too exhausted to
utter a word.</p>

<p>Ethel bent down and pressed her lips on the wasted little
hand, and when she met the gaze of the half-conscious
blue eyes she whispered, too low for any one to hear:</p>

<p>"Please don't tell any one I was there with you,
Precious, until you get well enough for me to explain."</p>

<p>The little hand she was holding gave hers a weak
pressure that showed her that Precious understood and
would not speak.</p>

<p>The others, looking on at the little by-play, thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that Ethel was only whispering to Precious of her joy at
her return.</p>

<p>A week passed and the sick girl slowly gained strength
enough to tell the story of her persecutions at the hands
of Lindsey Warwick and his mother, but the pair of
plotters had made good their escape and were now beyond
the senator's vengeance.</p>

<p>There was one thing that always seemed strange to
them, and that was how Kay had found the way to his
mistress. The girl always explained it in an embarrassed,
halting fashion.</p>

<p>"The old woman just unlocked the door, pushed Kay
in, and went away again," she said. "And just a little
later the flames burst through the side of the wall. I&mdash;I&mdash;looked
out of the window and saw that I could not
escape, then I fainted."</p>

<p>"Lindsey Warwick probably stole Kay and took him
there, thinking to please you," said the senator, and his
black eyes flashed as he thought of the vengeance he
would take on the kidnaper if he ever found him.</p>

<p>They did not dream of the dark secret that lay behind
the reluctance of Precious to talk of the mastiff's presence
in her prison. They could not guess of the twilight
hour when Ethel, sitting alone by her sister for a little
while, had knelt down by Precious and begged her not to
tell of her presence the day of the fire.</p>

<p>"When I saw you fall back in the smoke, Precious, I
thought you were dead, and I ran away in a frenzy of
despair and came home, afraid to tell mamma because I
believed the awful news would kill her. I thought a
merciful silence would be best, so I kept the awful secret.
And if you told them now, dear, perhaps they would
blame me. They would say I ought to have sent you
down the rope first, but you know how that was, dear. I
wanted to be at the bottom to catch you if you should fall."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, dear sister, and I don't think they
would blame you if we told them," sighed Precious; but
because Ethel insisted on it she gave the promise of
silence.</p>

</div></div>


<p>But Precious improved too slowly to please the careful
doctor.</p>

<p>The long fast and the subsequent shock had told severely
on her young frame, and it was almost the last of March
when she was able to come out of her room. Then she
looked too thin, too frail, too lily-like, to please those who
loved her best.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans, you must take her away from Washington
to the country; she needs mountain air," said Doctor
Heron.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, what an idea! Leave Washington before
the season is over! How can you tell mamma that?"
pouted Ethel.</p>

<p>The selfish, dark-eyed beauty had resumed all the gayeties
of the brilliant Washington season as soon as her sister
was declared out of danger, and dragged her gentle, yielding
mother day after day from receptions to balls, from
dinners to operas. Ethel was a belle, and would not yield
her scepter; so Norah nursed the sick girl; and the
mother who, because she loved Precious best, indulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Ethel most, followed with a sad heart into scenes of
revelry, leaving her tenderest thoughts at home.</p>

<p>So Ethel was almost indignant when the physician
ordered Mrs. Winans to the mountains with her ailing
daughter.</p>

<p>At the proud beauty's protest Doctor Heron smiled and
answered carelessly:</p>

<p>"You can remain in Washington, Miss Winans."</p>

<p>"But mamma&mdash;my chaperon! Of course I couldn't go
into society without her. Really, I think that Precious
can get on here till May, when we will go away for the
summer."</p>

<p>The physician looked disgusted at her selfishness, and
turned again to her mother.</p>

<p>"I repeat that Miss Precious should be taken to the
mountains before the first of April, or her recovery will be
very tedious. It is a case of nervous prostration," he
said.</p>

<p>"You can send Norah with her, mamma; that will do
very well, don't you think so?" Ethel cried airily; but
there was a look of pain on the gentle face of Mrs. Winans,
and she did not reply.</p>

<p>Earle, who was present at the conclave, broke in:</p>

<p>"How fortunate that your distant relative in Virginia
left you her lovely mountain estate when she died last
fall, mother. It is the very place to take Precious, doctor,
and not more than a hundred miles from here. The kind
spinster who left it to us had it elegantly appointed, and
nothing has been changed. I think even the old family
servants are yet in charge."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented his mother. "You see, I intended
going there for a part of this summer. It is a charming
mountain country, doctor. The estate is called Rosemont,
and there is a pretty country town of the same name near
by. The air is fine and pure."</p>

<p>"The very place for your drooping daughter," cried
Doctor Heron. "Send her as soon as you can, Mrs.
Winans, and if you can't be spared from Washington just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
now, let the good nurse Norah take your place. She will
do excellently well."</p>

<p>"And I will go, too, to take care of the little one. I'm
tired of the social whirl," cried Earle Winans, and was
rewarded by a beaming smile of gratitude from his adoring
mother. He did not care for Ethel's sullen brow, and
inwardly characterized her as selfish and unloving.</p>

<p>"To keep mother dancing attendance on her here when
she looks so pale and worn and needs a change almost as
much as Precious does!" the noble young man thought
indignantly.</p>

<p>So the plan was carried out. The delicate, drooping
girl was sent to Rosemont with her brother and the good
nurse Norah, and Ethel drew a long breath of relief when
they were gone.</p>

<p>"Two months of relief from their silly worship at least,
for I shall not go to Rosemont any sooner if I can possibly
avoid it," she cried angrily.</p>

<p>One thing that pleased her well was that Lord Chester
and Precious had not yet met, for the young lord had gone
away from the city as soon as it was announced that
Precious would recover. Washington had lionized him
after his heroic act, and in sheer bashfulness he had run
away to travel round a few weeks until his fame blew
over, he laughingly explained to his friend Earle.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was more in it than he had confessed.</p>

<p>Lord Chester regretted with a bitter pain that he
had given Ethel Winans cause to expect an offer of his
hand and heart.</p>

<p>From the day that he had first seen the portrait of
Precious his heart had turned away from proud, queenly
Ethel to her gentle younger sister. The strange chance
by which he had saved her sweet young life only drew her
closer to his heart.</p>

<p>Yet in all honor his fealty belonged to dark-eyed Ethel.</p>

<p>In desperation he went away to try to forget the blue
eyes that were luring him from his honor.</p>

<p>And he remained away until he received a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Earle Winans, telling him of all that had happened since
he left Washington.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are here at Rosemont&mdash;Precious and I; the <i>mater</i> and Ethel
are still in the Capitol City. Precious is improving slowly but
surely in the fine mountain air, and I&mdash;well, I fear I'm losing my
heart to a village coquette, the daintiest fairy I ever saw. Rosemont
is a very gay little town, with some nice people&mdash;old Virginia
stock, you know."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Lord Chester resolved to go back to Washington
and see Ethel again. Perhaps now that Precious was gone
his heart might return to its first love.</p>

<p>"You'll rue the day if you marry him," cried Aura
Stanley sharply.</p>

<p>She leaned against a rose-wreathed pillar of the porch,
a tall girl in pink, with hard black eyes and thick brown
hair in a rich braid. She lived next door and was the
village lawyer's only daughter.</p>

<p>Before the Conways came here to live, five weeks ago,
Aura had been called the prettiest girl in the village, but
now the town was divided into two factions over the rival
beauties, and among those who had gone over to the
enemy was one on whom Aura's passionate heart was set.</p>

<p>"You'll rue the day, Ladybird, if you marry him,"
repeated Aura angrily, and held up her shapely white hand,
on which glittered a splendid diamond ring; but, to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
surprise and horror, the little dancing madcap laughed
and answered teasingly:</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I'll be wearing that ring in a week,
Aura."</p>

<p>"Never! I'll throw it in the river first," flashed Aura,
and Aunt Prue caught the glance of jealous hate in the
girl's black eyes.</p>

<p>She exclaimed soothingly:</p>

<p>"Aura, the child is only teasing thee. She does not
want thy lover, dear."</p>

<p>Ladybird Conway turned her laughing hazel eyes on
the old lady and protested gayly:</p>

<p>"But, Auntie Prue, he's my lover now. Doesn't he
call on me three times a week, and send me flowers and
books and candy? And hasn't he promised to escort me
to the picnic to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"He asked me first, but I refused," cried Aura
triumphantly, and added spitefully: "I wouldn't take
what another girl refused."</p>

<p>"Neither would I!" flashed Ladybird, with such sarcastic
emphasis that Aura flushed burning red at the intimation
that she had told a falsehood.</p>

<p>"Girls, girls, don't thee quarrel over nothing!" cried
the old Quakeress anxiously, but Aura was furious.</p>

<p>"Ladybird Conway, I'll never speak to you again," she
cried, and flew down the graveled path, shutting the front
gate with a vicious slam.</p>

<p>Aunt Prue cried out reprovingly:</p>

<p>"Thee has lost thy young friend forever, Ladybird, and
thee ought to be ashamed of thyself, taking another girl's
lover so audaciously."</p>

<p>"But he isn't hers&mdash;so there! I know, because I asked
him. I said she claimed him, and if that was so not to
come to see me any more. But he denied it. He said he
had only known her two weeks when we moved here, and
had no idea of being engaged to her. He lent her the
ring because she asked him to, and she's only trying to
claim him to vex me," and the lovely face, with its dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
hazel eyes and lilies and roses, looked quite earnest for a
moment.</p>

<p>"But, child, thee ain't in love with this Earle Winans?
Thee ain't thinking of marrying him, dear?"</p>

<p>Willful Ladybird smiled and blushed, and answered
roguishly:</p>

<p>"Why, Auntie Prue, of course I intend to get married
some time; I don't want to be an old maid like you; but
I mean to marry the man that loves me best."</p>

<p>"The one that loves thee best? But, child, how can
thee guess that out of thirteen lovers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a grand plan to test all my lovers&mdash;at the
picnic to-morrow!" and the fair face dimpled all over
with mischievous laughter.</p>

<p>"Are they all going&mdash;the thirteen? Thee will not
have any peace, child, and the other girls will be jealous."</p>

<p>"I don't care. It's such fun to have so many admirers
showing me attention at the same time," laughed the little
incarnation of sunny beauty and unconscious cruelty.</p>

<p>"But it's cruel to make the young men suffer so!"
hazarded the kind-hearted old lady, and again the girl
laughed archly:</p>

<p>"Suffer? Oh, pshaw! they need to have the conceit
taken out of them," and Ladybird began to run over the
category of the faults and foibles of her admirers, making
such sarcastic hits that the old Quakeress shook with
silent laughter and gave up her futile lecture on coquetry.</p>

<p>But when the girl paused for breath, all rosy and laughing,
Aunt Prue exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Thee hasn't said a word about thy last lover&mdash;about
Earle Winans."</p>

<p>"My thirteenth lover. Oh, no, I have no fault to find
with him. He is simply perfect," cried Ladybird, as
innocently as if she had not guessed that Aura Stanley
was listening behind her parlor blinds to every word.</p>

<p>Aura was listening, her eyes wrathful, her cheeks
burning.</p>

<p>But she heard no more just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>After that saucy parting shot Ladybird sat down on the
porch steps like a little child, with her round, dimpled chin
in the hollow of her soft little hand, and fell to watching
the rosy sunset as the god of day sank to rest behind the
purple western hills. Her face wore a pensive cast that
made her look positively angelic. And yet she was
actually meditating a deed of girlish <i>diablerie</i> on the
morrow, the naughty little coquette!</p>

<p>The next day was perfect&mdash;a May day, clear and golden,
and when the fervid sunbeams began to dry the dew-tears
from the eyes of the blue violets in the grass, the gay
picnic party assembled in the Rosemont orchard by the
river, the scene of the day's festivities.</p>

<p>All the prettiest girls of the village were there, and not
one of Ladybird's lovers had stayed away. And how
they envied handsome Earle Winans, who was her special
companion for the day, while they had to be content with
other girls&mdash;pretty enough, to be sure&mdash;but&mdash;"not the rose."</p>

<p>Aura Stanley had come with Clarence Grey, but she
knew she was second choice, that he had asked Ladybird
first, and she could hardly control her bitter resentment.</p>

<p>Ladybird gave her a saucy nod and smile when they
met, but Aura averted her head in jealous anger when
she saw how lovely her rival looked in her white flannel
suit with the blue silk blouse showing under the open
white jacket, and the white sailor hat crowning the little
head, with its fluffy rings of golden brown.</p>

<p>"Miss Stanley would not speak to you&mdash;why?" Earle
Winans asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because I teased her yesterday. I&mdash;I&mdash;told her I'd be
wearing that ring of yours within a week," and Ladybird
gave him a coquettish side glance from her dazzling eyes
that made his heart leap and his cheek burn.</p>

<p>She was playing with fire, this thoughtless girl, for
Earle Winans' heart knew how to love with burning
passion.</p>

<p>His voice trembled with emotion as he said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Would you like to have the ring, Miss Conway?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I, Mr. Winans? Why, certainly not. I was only
teasing Aura; she seemed to prize it so highly and declared
she would throw it in the river before I should
have it," asserted Ladybird, gayly.</p>

<p>"I will get the ring for you any minute you say you'll
wear it, Ladybird. You know what I mean&mdash;as my
betrothed," murmured her handsome young lover eagerly.</p>

<p>Ladybird blushed rosy red, then smiled brightly and
whispered back:</p>

<p>"I'll give you my answer to-morrow."</p>

<p>And all his pleading would not induce her to shorten
his probation.</p>

<p>"To-morrow&mdash;you must wait till to-morrow," she
repeated, but her drooping eyes and rosy blushes made
him almost certain what her answer would be.</p>

<p>Aura Stanley watched the lovers with a jealous pang,
for it was a cruel blow to lose Earle, whom she had hoped
to captivate, not only because she loved him, but because
he was the son of a great man and had a fortune in his
own right. She was ambitious and longed to reign a
social queen.</p>

<p>By some clever maneuvering she managed to get a
<i>tête-à-tête</i> by the river bank with Earle that day, and then
she said coldly:</p>

<p>"Ah, really, I must return your ring, Mr. Winans."</p>

<p>She held the glittering circlet toward him on the end
of her taper finger, and somehow, just as he was about to
accept the ring, it slipped off Aura's finger, flashed like
an evil eye in the sunlight, then rolled into the river.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry&mdash;but it was an accident," cried
Aura quickly.</p>

<p>The young man's eyes flashed with anger, and he cried
with stinging contempt:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you did it on purpose, because you thought I
meant to give it to Miss Conway. But it does not matter;
I will buy her a prettier one to-morrow."</p>

<p>Aura sprang to her feet, her eyes blazing, her cheeks
crimson, and exclaimed in a loud, angry voice:</p>

<p>"You villain! How dare you insult me like that?"</p>

<p>Those angry words to Aura Stanley had barely passed
Earle Winans' lips ere he regretted them, although he
knew quite well that she had deserved them, and had
dropped the ring purposely, as she had told Ladybird she
would do.</p>

<p>But he regretted his exhibition of temper, and was
about to apologize, when her angry words arrested the
speech on his lips.</p>

<p>"You villain! How dare you insult me like that!"</p>

<p>Although they seemed to be alone on the river-bank,
there were several young men near by under a tree, and,
catching Aura's angry denunciation, they hurried to the
spot.</p>

<p>Aura turned quickly toward them, exclaiming maliciously:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, Earle Winans has insulted me, and if I
had a brother to take my part he should knock the coward
down!"</p>

<p>All of these young gentlemen admired Ladybird Conway,
and envied Earle Winans because she had shown a
preference for him. Accordingly they were eager to take
Aura's part, just to humiliate their dangerous rival. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
foremost one therefore sprang with fierce agility at Earle
just as he was rising from his seat on the grassy bank, and
with a stinging blow knocked him backward to the
ground.</p>

<p>There was laughter&mdash;spiteful from Aura, appreciative
from the men&mdash;but it did not last long.</p>

<p>Earle Winans scarcely touched the earth ere he rebounded
like a ball, and flew directly at Jack Tennant, his
adversary, a big, burly fellow, with fists like iron.</p>

<p>Earle was slender, but he was an athlete too, and with
a rush he caught his assailant around the waist with both
arms, lifted him almost above his head, and hurled him
with superb strength far out into the river, firing after
him this parting shot:</p>

<p>"There, my lad! a cold bath will cool your temper!"
Then he turned a scornful smile on the others. "Are
there any more who wish to play the rôle of Miss Stanley's
brothers?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; the quarrel is between you and Jack Tennant,"
they hastily replied, having no desire to be made
ridiculous like their hasty friend, who was now swimming
ashore, his picnic toggery, sash and flannels, dripping and
ruined, but with his rage not yet cooled, for as he clambered
up the bank he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Earle Winans, I will fight this quarrel out with
you now."</p>

<p>Earle's handsome face flushed with anger, but, holding
in his temper, he answered with cool scorn:</p>

<p>"Your pardon, but it would not be quite proper to
settle it in a lady's presence. I will send a friend to you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"A duel! Oh, Heaven!" cried Aura, in a panic of fear,
but no one seemed to notice her as she sank trembling on
the grassy bank. Mark Gwinn exclaimed kindly:</p>

<p>"I'll drive you home for your dry clothes, Jack, and we
can be back in a jiffy."</p>

<p>They were all turning away, but Earle Winans arrested
them with one stern word:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>They all turned back to him in impatient surprise.</p>

<p>Pale with anger, he pointed to Aura, crouching on the
green, flowery bank.</p>

<p>"Miss Stanley, you must now repeat to these gentlemen
who defended you the words of my insult."</p>

<p>Flashing on Earle a glance of sullen resentment, she
obeyed.</p>

<p>"I dropped his diamond ring into the water&mdash;and he
said I did it on purpose."</p>

<p>"Was that all?" exclaimed a wondering voice.</p>

<p>"That was all," Aura answered indignantly, and every
one turned away and left Aura alone with the bitter consciousness
that they despised her, while as for Jack Tennant,
he felt decidedly blue at the prospect of a duel with
the fiery Earle Winans for the sake of a girl he didn't care
two straws for, as he, like all the others, adored the bewitching
Miss Conway.</p>

<p>But Aura had carried out her threat to Ladybird. The
beautiful ring was in the river, and would never shine on
the little white hand of her lovely rival. Her jealous
malice was gratified, at least, and she cared very little if
Earle fought a duel and lost his life. She would rather
see him dead than married to that little coquette Ladybird.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Conway, all unconscious of what had
happened at the lower end of the orchard, was sitting on
a mossy throne under a wide-spreading apple tree, holding
mimic court. Her adoring subjects had woven a wreath
of apple blossoms, and crowned her Queen of May.</p>

<p>"Somebody give us a song, please. It's a day for love,
and poetry, and song!" she cried gayly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think the birds sing sweetest, dear?" asked
a fair girl by her side, one that she called her maid of
honor.</p>

<p>But the girl under the next nearest tree&mdash;the girl with
the guitar&mdash;thought differently. She touched her instrument
with soft, loving fingers, and her tender voice was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
low and sweet that it seemed to blend with the bird songs,
the soft rustle of the leaves, and the ripple of the river.</p>

</div></div>

<p>While the pretty girl was singing, Earle Winans came
up silently and stood by the tree, looking down at Ladybird
with the apple-blossom wreath on her shining hair.</p>

<p>Ladybird's arch, pretty face had grown pensive while
she listened to the song, and her tiny white hand, with its
babyish dimples, played absently with a branch of pink
crab-apple blooms that lay in her lap. She was more
lovely than any picture ever painted, and Earle's heart
swelled with a passionate longing to catch the exquisite
young creature in his arms and press all that budding
beauty against his ardent breast.</p>

<p>Ladybird knew that he was there, but she would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
turn her head; and when the song came to an end she
sighed and murmured softly:</p>

<p>"I wonder what this love is like of which poets sing,
and lovers rave, and spring-birds warble. It must be very
sweet."</p>

<p>"My darling, let me teach you all its sweetness," murmured
Earle's voice in her ear, but though a swift blush
burned her face, she shrugged her willful shoulders, and
continued in a louder voice, that all around might
hear:</p>

<p>"If I ever <i>do</i> fall in love, it will be with a <i>hero</i>, with
some man who has done something great, or perhaps
risked his life to save mine. I don't believe I could
ever love a common, everyday sort of man, like the
ones I know, unless he turned out to be a <i>hero</i>. Then I
could worship him!"</p>

<p>And just a few hours later those words, spoken in such
artless innocence, came back to the heart of every man
there&mdash;came back with a thrill of love and hope.</p>

<p>She had stolen away from them all a short time before,
and just as they were wondering what had become of the
little sprite, they heard some one singing blithely on the
river.</p>

<p>It was Ladybird in a little blue boat, rowing herself
with consummate skill, the water falling in silvery
sparkles from the light oars. Her pretty face glowed
rosily, and her eyes danced with fun as she trilled a gay
little boating song. It was the bonniest sight ever seen
on the broad, beautiful river flowing between its banks of
spring-time green.</p>

<p>Every one ran down to the bank&mdash;every one but Aura
Stanley, who sulked beneath a tree.</p>

<p>"Take me in, Ladybird&mdash;take me!" called one after
another eagerly; but she cried out saucily:</p>

<p>"I will take one of the gentlemen to row me, because my
arms are getting tired."</p>

<p>All in a minute followed the terrible accident.</p>

<p>In the middle of the river where she was rowing it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
deep and dangerous, but she seemed to forget that in her
joyous excitement; and, turning the boat too quickly
toward the shore, it careened over, and Ladybird fell into
the water. One long shriek of fear and terror, and
the rippling waves of the beautiful river closed sullenly
over the little head!</p>

<p>A cry of grief arose from fifty throats, but it was
speedily turned to a cheer, for&mdash;Splash! splash! splash!
came the sounds, too fast to count, and twelve out of
Ladybird's thirteen lovers had leaped boldly into the river
to save her precious life.</p>

<p>Rosemont was one of the most ideally beautiful summer
houses in Fauquier County.</p>

<p>It was a large white mansion, in villa style, surrounded
by flower-gardens and pleasure-grounds, with a charming
mountain view, and, nearer home, the silvery windings of
the Rappahannock River forming the southern boundary
of the large estate.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the picnic Precious Winans swung
lazily in a hammock on the long front piazza, while her
favorite, Kay, the immense mastiff, lay within touch of
the tiny white hand that every little while reached down
to caress the tawny head.</p>

<p>At some distance away Mistress Norah, the good-natured
nurse, sat cozily in an armchair, knitting lace.</p>

<p>Along the lattice-work that shaded the end of the piazza
clambered a great honeysuckle vine loaded with odorous,
creamy-white blooms. Here the busy little bees hummed
ceaselessly, bright-winged butterflies hovered, and two
robins flew in and out of the branches with straws for a
nest. The golden sunshine sifting through the leaves in
light and shade on the girl's white gown and sunny head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
seemed like the spirit of peace spreading its brooding
wings over the lovely, quiet scene.</p>

<p>Precious had been reading a book of poems. It lay
open now under one white hand, and with half-shut,
dreamy eyes, she was recalling the last lines she had
read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Love gives itself, but is not bought;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor voice, nor sound betrays<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its deep impassioned gaze.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It comes&mdash;the beautiful, the free,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The crown of all humanity,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In silence and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To seek the elected one."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The velvety blue of the young girl's eyes looked very
soft and tender under the long-fringed lashes that were so
dark by contrast with the sunshine of her hair.</p>

<p>She was wondering when love would come to her, and
if she would find it sweet.</p>

<p>"Ethel is in love, and she seems very happy," she
thought. "And there is Earle&mdash;he seems grave and
thoughtful lately; and my wise nurse, Norah, declares it's
because he is losing his heart to a lovely girl down in the
village, a little creature with hazel eyes like stars, and a
dimpled face all lilies and roses. I would like to see this
pretty girl, only Norah keeps me almost a prisoner, lest I
should be kidnaped again. I asked Earle about her, and
he laughed and colored, and said perhaps he would bring
her to see me some day."</p>

<p>She lifted her voice, and cried out:</p>

<p>"Norah, I wish we could go down to the picnic. I
can catch voices on the breeze&mdash;voices and laughter. They
seem to be having a lovely time, and it is so poky here!
Earle is there, you know. Do let us go, too&mdash;you and me
and Kay!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear, not for the world! The doctor said
you were to be very quiet here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am quite well again. See how plump my cheeks
are, and how rosy!"</p>

<p>"But, my Precious, you are very nervous yet. In your
dreams you start and cry out about the fire, and the dreadful
old woman, and your sister Ethel."</p>

<p>"What about Ethel?" demanded Precious quickly, the
delicate color flying from her cheeks.</p>

<p>Nurse Norah answered placidly:</p>

<p>"In your dreams, dearie, it always seems as if Ethel
had been with you that day when you were struggling to
get out of the fire. Once you cried out, 'Ethel, Ethel,
the rope is finished, and you are going down first, then I
will follow. And you will catch me if I fall!' Then again
you cried: 'The rope has broken. Ethel, are you hurt?
No, no, I cannot jump now! I am lost! lost! lost!'"</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes of Precious grew wild and startled.</p>

<p>"Oh, what strange dreams!" she cried tremblingly.
"I wish you had not listened, Norah; they were only
dreams!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, my pet, but they show that you are not
quite strong yet, and it is better not to go about into
society until you are well again. But I think you ought
to have some young girls to visit you, and I will ask your
brother to bring that little star-eyed village girl to see
you."</p>

<p>"She is here now!" cried Earle's voice, with a ripple of
laughter in its low music.</p>

<p>They started and looked, and there he stood with a
dripping figure by his side, a girl in white flannel, bareheaded,
with wet brown curls all over her little head, and
starry hazel eyes alight with laughter.</p>

<p>"Miss Conway has had an accident&mdash;fallen into the
river, Precious, and I brought her up here for some of
your dry clothes, also to make your acquaintance, as I
knew you were lonely," explained Earle easily.</p>

<p>"You poor darling!" cried Precious, and her heart
went out to the little beauty in a swift rush of tenderness.
She took Ladybird's hand. "Come, let us go upstairs.
My clothes will fit you, I know!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Earle detained them a moment.</p>

<p>"I am going down to the telegraph office a moment.
Please stay here till I come back, Miss Conway. I will
take you home in due time."</p>

<p>"I thank you," Ladybird answered with a stiff little
courtesy, then she followed Precious and Norah upstairs.</p>

<p>Some dry garments were soon found, and Norah took
the wet ones away.</p>

<p>"You shall have them nice and dry directly," she said
kindly, but as she took her way kitchenward, she mused:
"This pretty girl reminds me very, very much of the
lovely Miss Clendenon, Mrs. Winans' girl-friend, that
afterward married Mr. Bruce Conway. This one is like
her, but it could not be her daughter, for the little one
she named for my mistress, Grace Willard, died before it
was a year old, and poor Mrs. Conway, sweet little soul,
died herself two years after, and I never heard that she
left a child, although to be sure we were abroad then, and
when we got home all the Conways were dead but Mr.
Bruce, and he had disappeared. He always was a rolling
stone."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two young girls, left alone in the beautiful
airy room upstairs, proceeded to get acquainted.</p>

<p>"I don't feel any worse from my ducking, dear, but
I'll lie on the bed awhile and rest," cried Ladybird,
rumpling up her wet curls with taper fingers.</p>

<p>"Do, dear, and tell me all about it. How did you
happen to fall in?" asked Precious.</p>

<p>"It's a long story, Miss Winans," laughingly.</p>

<p>"Call me Precious," said the girl sweetly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will; but is that your real name? I
never heard of any one named Precious."</p>

<p>"My real name is Pearl; but my mamma called me
Precious Pearl so much that it became shortened at last
to Precious."</p>

<p>"And my name is Lulu, but my dear mamma died soon
after I was born, and then papa could not bear to hear
that name spoken, because it had been hers. So they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
began with Ladybird when I was little, and it has been my
name ever since, so I will call you Precious if you will call
me Ladybird."</p>

<p>"Very well. And now, Ladybird, you will tell me how
you came to fall in the water."</p>

<p>She saw the hazel eyes flash with laughter, and Ladybird
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Precious, will you keep it secret? Will you never,
never tell?"</p>

<p>"Never!" answered Precious promptly, and then her
guest said gayly:</p>

<p>"I was in a little row-boat on the river, and I fell into
the water. They all thought it was an accident, but&mdash;you're
never to tell any one, you know&mdash;I did it purposely.
I fell in for them to jump in and rescue me."</p>

<p>"But why?" queried Precious, with astonished blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," answered the little madcap, with a
silvery peal of laughter. "I have several lovers, Precious,
and I wanted to test their love. I thought the one that
loved me best would jump in after me."</p>

<p>"And did he, Ladybird?"</p>

<p>"They <i>all</i> jumped, Precious!"</p>

<p>"All? How many?"</p>

<p>"Twelve," answered Ladybird, with a little <i>moue</i> of
actual disgust.</p>

<p>Then the astonishment of the other girl's face moved
her to mocking laughter.</p>

<p>"You darling girl! how surprised you look! But I
don't blame you. It was very silly for them all to jump
in after me! I shall never forget when I lay on the bank
after I was rescued, how funny they all looked in their
wet clothes, as they crowded around me!" and she laughed
ungratefully.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;<i>twelve</i> lovers!&mdash;I never heard of a girl having
so many!" and the younger girl's eyes dilated with
wonder.</p>

<p>"Did you never have a lover, Precious?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am too young&mdash;only sixteen," and Precious
blushed at the very thought of a lover.</p>

<p>"I am only seventeen, and I have a dozen. I thought
I had thirteen, but when I tested them there were but
twelve," cried Ladybird, tossing her dainty head with
decided pique.</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;my&mdash;brother&mdash;jump in the water after you?"
cried Precious quickly.</p>

<p>"No, indeed&mdash;he was not a hero like the others," and
Ladybird curled a disdainful lip.</p>

<p>"Do you like heroes, Ladybird?"</p>

<p>"I adore them! If I ever marry any one, he must be
brave and grand. I couldn't love a coward!"</p>

<p>"I admire heroes too," cried Precious, her cheek glowing
with sudden warmth, her violet eyes shining; and then
Ladybird cried eagerly:</p>

<p>"You must admire Lord Chester very much, dear, for
I read in the papers how he rescued you from a burning
house. It was grand, was it not? and I suppose you will
be sure to marry him some day, for that is the way it
always turns out in novels."</p>

<p>"You must be very romantic," answered Precious,
smiling, though the crimson blushes seemed to burn her
lovely face. A moment later she added, in a pensive tone:
"I have never seen Lord Chester but once. He is very
grand and handsome, but he is my sister Ethel's lover."</p>

<p>"Oh! So he saved your life for her sweet sake! She
must really adore him for his bravery; but I wish he would
fall in love with you now, you beautiful darling!" cried
impulsive Ladybird, entirely disregarding Ethel's claim in
her love of romantic denouements.</p>

<p>Norah came in just then with Ladybird's clothing nicely
dried and pressed, and by the time she was dressed, and
the fluffy curls dried, Earle Winans returned to take her
home. As it was almost sunset, she took an affectionate
leave of her new friend, promising to keep up the pleasant
friendship begun to-day, neither of them dreaming of the
untoward events that a day was to bring forth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DID A SHADOW FROM THE FUTURE FALL OVER THAT
YOUNG, DREAMING HEART?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like the changeful month of spring<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Is my love, my lady-love;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sunshine beams and glad birds sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then a rain-cloud floats above:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So your moods change with the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">April-tempered lady-love;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All the sweeter to my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You're a riddle, lady-love."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>As Earle Winans took his seat by Ladybird in his
elegant little phaeton, she stole a quick glance at his dark,
handsome face, and wondered at the gravity of his
thoughtful eyes. She did not know of the scene with
Aura that afternoon, or she would have understood his
mood.</p>

<p>He did not look at her nor speak to her for several
minutes, and suddenly he heard a low, half-suppressed
sob.</p>

<p>He turned to her quickly, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Ladybird? You are not ill from
your wetting?"</p>

<p>But a tempest of anger was swelling in the little beauty's
breast, and her first words showed him the cause.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't care if I died, you great big coward!"
she sobbed, and a pearly tear dropped from her long eyelash
and splashed upon her cheek.</p>

<p>"Ladybird!" indignantly.</p>

<p>"Don't call me Ladybird! I'm Miss Conway to you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
after to-day! You didn't care if I was drowned! You
didn't jump in the river to save me like those noble
heroes! You just stood on the bank with your arms
folded, afraid of getting drowned or spoiling your nice
clothes, maybe," with a scornful glance. "Then, when
the others had rescued me, and brought me to shore, you
came so coolly and made me go up to your house with you
for some dry clothes. And&mdash;and&mdash;before to-day I had
thought you were so noble, so brave!" sobbed Ladybird,
in passionate earnest, for she had plotted the little romance
just to show Aura Stanley her power over Earle, and the
failure was a cruel blow.</p>

<p>But Earle did not take her tirade seriously. His dark
eyes twinkled and his lips twitched with repressed laughter
as he answered significantly:</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Conway, I hope I am always brave
enough to rescue any one in real danger, but I don't see
any heroism in wetting one's self to rescue a girl from the
river who threw herself in for fun, and who can swim as
well as anybody!"</p>

<p>"Fun, indeed? How dare you say it, when I was almost
drowned?" sobbed the little coquette perversely.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of danger!" laughed the young man, amused
at her pretense of anger. "Ah, Ladybird, no man could
love you better than I do; but, indeed, you are a vain
little darling, and ought to be ashamed of your little joke
that caused the ruination of twelve good flannel suits and
sashes. Don't you know, you willful little flirt, that they
will be shrunk to the size of bathing suits? And all to
gratify a whim of yours! Ah, little one, it was cleverly
done, but no one but myself guesses it was a ruse. I saw
you throw yourself out of the boat. I saw you dive, and
I remembered then your little hint about heroes awhile
before. It was all make-believe, little Miss Mischief, even
your pretense of unconsciousness, when Jack Tennant
pulled you out. As you lay on the bank I saw your eyelids
twitch and your lips curl with secret amusement.
You can't deny it, Ladybird."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ladybird would not meet the quizzical glance of
the laughing dark eyes. Her bosom heaved with wounded
pride as she thought how Aura Stanley would triumph
over her defeat. Ladybird had been reared in a boarding-school,
and had imbibed all sorts of romantic fancies from
surreptitious novels. Earle Winans' failure to realize her
ideal of a hero had almost broken her tender little heart.</p>

<p>So she would not be laughed or coaxed into a good
humor. She pouted charmingly and willfully, and at
length she sobbed angrily:</p>

<p>"You may think it very amusing to tease me so, Earle
Winans, but I will make you sorry for to-day before the
week is out!" and as they drew rein just then at her
father's door, she sprang hastily out on the pavement and
ran into the house without a word of thanks or good-by.</p>

<p>"Whew! what a tantrum! but the dear little heart will
forget and forgive by to-morrow," thought Earle, as he
drove back home to tell Norah that he expected a guest in
the morning&mdash;Lord Chester, who would stay at Rosemont
a day or two.</p>

<p>He did not tell her that he had telegraphed for his
friend to come, much less that he wanted him to act as
his second in a duel. But Jack Tennant's blow was one
that Earle's fiery heart would never forgive without an
apology. He had determined to challenge him, and he
would not ask any of the young men in Rosemont to carry
the message. He wanted Lord Chester.</p>

<p>He believed that Ethel held the young nobleman's heart;
he did not dream of danger to the fair young sister whose
waist he clasped with a loving arm as she stood by him on
the piazza while he told Norah to prepare the finest rooms
in the house for the coming guest.</p>

<p>And there was no hint of a tragedy or sorrow in the
balmy air, nor in the sunset sky where the rosy tints
faded to purple, and the full moon rose over the sharp
outline of the distant hills and flooded the world with its
silver glory.</p>

<p>Precious did not speak one word, but her heart thrilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with a silent rapture as pure as the moonlight flooding the
world with light.</p>

<p>"I shall see him&mdash;I can thank him with my own lips
for saving my life," she thought happily, and at night
she sat alone at her window when Norah believed she was
asleep, thinking of the morrow, when Ethel's lover was
coming.</p>

<p>She thought of Ladybird too, and her romantic fancies
and hero-worship.</p>

<p>"It was a strange fancy that Lord Chester might some
day be my lover," she mused, and added, with an unconscious
sigh: "Perhaps&mdash;he&mdash;might&mdash;have been&mdash;only that
he loved Ethel first!"</p>

<p>Did a shadow from the nearing future fall over that
young dreaming heart&mdash;some prescience of the pathetic
truth of the poet's plaint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She sat long by the open window watching the beautiful
night with solemn, wide blue eyes, and a strange sadness
crept over her spirit, a loneliness never felt before. Tears
came at last, tears, and low, soft sobs.</p>

<p>Norah caught the sound in the next room, where she
dozed upon her pillow, and hurried in.</p>

<p>"What, darling! sitting up in your nightgown, catching
cold at the open window?" and she carried her in her
strong arms to the bed and piled the snowy covers over the
shivering form. "Did you have dreams that frightened
you, pet?" she continued, as she warmed the cold little
hands between her own.</p>

<p>Precious, trying to hush her hysteric sobs, murmured
faintly:</p>

<p>"I have never been asleep, Norah. I was sitting at
the window watching the beautiful stars, and thinking&mdash;of
many things. Then I grew sad&mdash;I do not know
why&mdash;and&mdash;and the tears came. I think I am homesick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
I want papa and mamma. I have been so long away from
them."</p>

<p>"I will write to Mrs. Winans to-morrow, and tell
her she must come to Rosemont very soon&mdash;that you are
lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am lonely," sighed Precious, all unconscious
that it was the restlessness of an awakening young
heart.</p>

<p>She fell asleep presently with the dew of tears still on
her lashes&mdash;slept, and dreamed fantastic dreams, in which
she saw Ladybird married to Lord Chester, and Ethel
drowning in the river, and herself and Kay perishing again
in the burning house.</p>

<p>"I think we shall find her here under her favorite
tree," said Earle Winans as he and Lord Chester came
down toward the river.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the picnic, and Earle had gone
after breakfast to the station to meet his friend, Lord
Chester.</p>

<p>Precious and Norah, with the ever faithful Kay, had
gone down to the river as soon as the dew was dry on the
grass.</p>

<p>Precious sat under an apple tree with her dog at her
feet. Norah chose another tree close by and resumed her
favorite lace knitting.</p>

<p>It was a scene of the most exquisite beauty, and the
spirit of peace seemed brooding over the spot.</p>

<p>The orchard trees were pink with bloom, and the soft
green grass was studded with violets, pale yellow cowslips
and golden buttercups. Overhead arched a sky as blue as
that of Italy, and in the sweet warm sunshine the blithe
birds were flitting and singing, while the hum of bees in
the may blooms blent in the music of the river rippling
along at the young girl's feet.</p>

<p>She had taken along a book to read, but she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
opened it yet. She was gazing dreamily at the river, now
and then throwing flowers on the swift-flowing stream and
watching them drift away out of sight.</p>

<p>So the young men came upon her unawares, and when
Lord Chester saw her he started with keen delight at the
lovely vision. When he had told Ethel how much he
admired her sister's portrait she had answered that it was
flattered, that Precious was not half so beautiful.</p>

<p>He realized instantly that Ethel had spoken falsely
that day.</p>

<p>Precious Winans, in her white gown and with her pearl-fair
face, velvet-blue eyes, and cloud of golden ringlets,
was the most exquisite beauty he had ever beheld. She
looked like a young angel strayed away from paradise,
and when she raised to his her liquid eyes, so
clear and innocent, he saw mirrored in their depths a pure,
true soul.</p>

<p>Then Earle said in his most genial tone:</p>

<p>"Precious, this is Lord Chester. You must be very
friendly with him, for some day he will be your brother.
He tells me he is engaged to Ethel."</p>

<p>"I am very glad," Precious answered simply.</p>

<p>She rose and put out her hand to him. He clasped it
a moment with lingering pressure, and while he held it
felt himself grow dizzy with a rapture so keen it was akin
to pain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From my swift blood that went and came,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A thousand little shafts of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were shivered in my narrow frame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He murmured something in a low voice, he scarcely
knew what; then Earle said carelessly:</p>

<p>"I will leave you two to entertain each other while I go
over and tease Norah a little."</p>

<p>He turned away and left the pair together&mdash;two young
romantic hearts in that romantic spot.</p>

<p>Precious stole a shy glance at her companion, and her
girlish heart thrilled with admiration for his manly
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>How grand and handsome he was! so tall, so graceful,
his complexion so clear and pale, his eyes such a splendid
dark-gray, his close-clipped hair such a shining chestnut
brown, where it lay in careless waves on his broad white
brow.</p>

<p>They sat down close together, and Kay, after one or
two suspicious sniffs, threw himself on Lord Chester fawningly,
recognizing him as his comrade on the eventful
occasion when their combined powers had saved Precious
from the fire.</p>

<p>"Kay remembers you," said Precious softly. "It was
to you and him I owed my life that night. I&mdash;I&mdash;have
wished to thank you so often, but now words fail me. Oh,
Lord Chester, I cannot express my gratitude. I was so
young to die like that&mdash;to leave the beautiful gay world!"</p>

<p>She spoke as if life was a great boon. She was so
young and fortunate, she did not dream of all the sorrow
the world contained; she had a horror of death, that is so
welcome to many.</p>

<p>"Do not thank me for doing my duty. It is reward
enough for me to be sitting here looking at you and listening
to you," he answered gently, as he caressed the mastiff
that fawned at his knee, and his words were simple truth.</p>

<p>It gave him a keen and subtle pleasure to breathe the
same air with Precious. The sky was bluer, the air
sweeter, the sunshine more golden, the bird songs sweeter,
because they two were together there, smiling at each
other.</p>

<p>"Tell me about papa and mamma," she said, after a
moment's silence.</p>

<p>"They are well. I saw them yesterday. I went to the
capitol with your mother and sister. Your father made
a great speech on the tariff&mdash;the most brilliant and telling
effort I ever heard from his lips. He was applauded to the
echo. The galleries went wild."</p>

<p>"Dear papa. If I only had been there!" she cried, and
her eyes kindled with pride.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon," he continued, "I attended Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Winans and Ethel to the reception at the White House
given by the president to the cabinet ministers, senators
and representatives. It was a grand affair, and the banquet
was magnificent."</p>

<p>"What did mamma wear? And Ethel?" she queried,
with feminine curiosity over silks and laces.</p>

<p>Lord Chester laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Very few men can describe a woman's dress. I'm not
an adept at it, but I remember how they looked. Your
mamma wore a pale silvery-blue brocade, softened by
dainty real lace and pearls and diamonds. She looked
very beautiful. Your sister looked like a queen, in a
white silk embroidered lavishly with gold. Her hair was
arranged in Grecian style with a fillet of gold studded
with rubies. She had so many admirers it was difficult
for any one to get within speaking distance."</p>

<p>"Dear Ethel, she is so beautiful. She looks like papa,
with his splendid eyes and rarely sweet smile! How I
wish I had been there with them! But mamma has
promised that I shall come out in society next winter. I
shall be past seventeen then&mdash;too young, mamma and
Ethel say, but papa is on my side, and we shall carry the
day!" with a sunny, willful smile.</p>

<p>"You are General Winans' favorite, I know," returned
the young man, smiling, and he said to himself that he
applauded her father's taste. His betrothed was very
beautiful and queenly, but her sister was the realization of
a man's ideal of everything lovely and lovable.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they thought of me moping here in the
country!" continued Precious softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure they did, for I heard your father saying
to his wife that he had been thinking of you all the
afternoon, and that he really must get away Saturday and
spend Sunday with you at Rosemont."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be so glad. I shall beg him to let me go
home with him," she cried beamingly. "Didn't they
send me any message by you, Lord Chester?"</p>

<p>"They didn't know I was coming. It was after I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
left them that evening I received the telegram from Earle
to join him here for a day or two. I didn't have time to
leave a note for Ethel; had to hustle to catch my train,
you know. I can send her a line to-day."</p>

<p>Earle sauntered back to them, saying:</p>

<p>"I am going to the house now. Have some letters to
write. Do you care to come now?"</p>

<p>"Do you need me?"</p>

<p>"Not for two hours yet."</p>

<p>"Then I will stay here with your sister awhile longer,
if she will let me. I am lazy to-day, and this <i>dolce far
niente</i> suits my mood exactly."</p>

<p>"Stay, then, for you certainly look the perfection of
indolence. Precious, you can bring him back when you
get ready."</p>

<p>He turned away and then Norah called:</p>

<p>"I must go back, too."</p>

<p>"I am coming presently," Precious answered coaxingly,
as she pulled Kay's ears.</p>

<p>Lord Chester picked up her book from the grass.</p>

<p>"You were reading. Perhaps I disturb you?" interrogatively.</p>

<p>"You may read to me, if you will. I should like it very
much," she answered, leaning her golden head back
against the tree, her eyes half closed and dreamy, a pensive
smile on her rosebud lips.</p>

<p>Seen thus she looked adorable. He gazed at her
earnestly and felt as if he would give the world to kiss
those exquisite crimson lips.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself together with a pang. He was
betrothed to Ethel. What right had he to feel his heart
throb faster at the sight of her sister's beauty? Those
luscious pouting lips were not for him.</p>

<p>The little blue book opened at random in his hand.
His eyes fell on a suggestive line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Devils laugh when mortals kiss."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The young man started and trembled. Then he read
on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>He was silent so long that the dreamy, half-shut eyes
unclosed and looked at him in wonder.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to read?" she asked in a tone of
disappointment.</p>

<p>"I don't think my voice is in tune to-day. I'm hoarse
as a raven. I'll read you a verse and then you will cry,
'Hold! enough.'"</p>

<p>She laughed, and Lord Chester began:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A sweeter, sadder thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My life for having known you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Forever with its sacred kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My soul's soul, I must own you<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Forever mine, my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From June to life's December&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not mine to have or hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But to pray for and remember."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His voice <i>was</i> discordant with the hoarseness of subtle
pain. He let the little book fall on the grass.</p>

<p>"You see?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes you do not read well," she answered frankly.
"But how can I amuse you? Shall I read to you, or
talk?"</p>

<p>"Neither," he replied with a forced smile. "Let us
sit very, very quiet for awhile and listen to the river.
It has a voice, you know, and when we listen thoughtfully
it will repeat over and over some one word, according to
your fancy. Then you shall tell me what it said to you
and I will confess what it said to me."</p>

<p>"What a romantic thought! but I like it," cried Precious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and for some time both remained silent; listening
to the low, monotonous ripple of the river.</p>

<p>She did not know that he wanted to be silent awhile
to fight a battle with his own heart, to gain strength to
bear a cross of pain.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked her presently in a gentle voice.</p>

<p>She answered pensively:</p>

<p>"It kept whispering, whispering over and over, one
sad word: 'Regret! regret! regret!'"</p>

<p>"Mine was similar," said Lord Chester. "Its burden
was, 'Too late! too late! too late!'"</p>

<p>He looked at her, and she lost her pensive air and smiled.</p>

<p>"I felt quite solemn while I was silent," she said.
"And it was several minutes before I could make out the
river's words. I am sorry they gave us plaintive words."</p>

<p>"I was wondering," he answered dreamily, "whether
each would catch the same word."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would have been very amusing," cried
Precious.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered gently, "there was one word&mdash;one&mdash;that
I should have liked it to echo to both our hearts.
I should have taken it for a prophecy."</p>

<p>"What word?" asked Precious with innocent curiosity.</p>

<p>In spite of herself she returned his look. Dark-gray
eyes met the tender blue ones in one long, lingering,
thrilling glance. What did they say to each other?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"How does Love speak?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the faint flush upon the tell-tale cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the uneven heart-throbs, and the freak<br /></span>

<span class="i34">In the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glance strikes with glance."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With an effort Precious withdrew her eyes from his,
the color flaming up into her cheeks, her bosom heaving
a low soft sigh, while Lord Chester echoed the sigh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
looked away at the distant hills in a strange silence. Yet
he had answered the girl's question without a word!</p>

<p>And after that it was hard to make conversation.</p>

<p>At last Precious grew frightened at her own silence.</p>

<p>She felt so strangely, her cheeks burned, her heart beat
heavily in the stillness, her lips seemed glued together.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke, but without turning his glance from
the mountains:</p>

<p>"Pardon my silence. I must seem very dull to you. I
was trying to hear the river say your word 'Regret.'"</p>

<p>And before she could answer he added:</p>

<p>"Do you know Miss Ingelow's poem 'Regret?'"</p>

<p>She answered in a low voice, with a deepening flush:</p>

<p>"Yes, I found it once in a book of mamma's, heavily
underlined. It begins like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"'Oh, that word Regret!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There have been nights and morns when we have sighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us alone, Regret.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ugh! it gives me the dismals!" he groaned, and she
paused diffidently.</p>

<p>That strange, throbbing silence fell again, and frightened
her. It was like some mesmeric spell.</p>

<p>She cried out quickly:</p>

<p>"Let us go up to the house."</p>

<p>Her broad leghorn sun-hat lay on the grass and she
stretched out her arm for it.</p>

<p>A terrible shriek followed.</p>

<p>In the soft green grass beneath the broad brim of the
hat a deadly rattlesnake had lain coiled. At her disturbing
touch it reared its evil head and struck its fangs into
her arm.</p>

<p>Lord Chester saw it all, and with a loud cry sprang forward,
setting his heel on the serpent's head ere it could
strike the second blow. It writhed hideously for a
moment, then lay still in death.</p>

<p>Precious had fallen back, deathly pale and half unconscious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
against the tree. He fell on his knees beside her
and cried out tenderly:</p>

<p>"Do not be frightened, my darling. I will suck the
poison from the wound."</p>

<p>And he placed his lips on the tiny wound on her slender
wrist and with desperate fervor drew forth the fatal
venom, spitting it again and again on the ground.</p>

<p>When he felt that the danger was removed, he looked
up at her and saw that her eyes wore closed in apparent
unconsiousness. With uncontrollable love he clasped her
in his arms and kissed the cold white lips, sobbing:</p>

<p>"My love! my darling!"</p>

<p>Lovers and poets rave of voices so dear and sweet that
they can call one back almost from the borders of the
grave.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is some little truth in those romantic
ravings.</p>

<p>Precious Winans had been lying back as mute and still
as some marble image of a dead maiden, but those frenzied
caresses, those sobbing whispers, "My love! my darling!"
sent the warm blood bounding sweetly through her veins
once more and her eyes opened with a dazed expression.</p>

<p>She saw Lord Chester's face bent close to hers with
actual tears in the splendid eyes, and her lips seemed to burn
with his kisses. Wildly she struggled out of his arms.</p>

<p>"How dare you kiss me?" she half moaned, trying to
be angry.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Precious, I thought you were dead and it
almost drove me mad. Do you not remember the dreadful
rattler? I sucked the poison from the wound, but I
must take you home at once and send for a physician,
although I do not believe there can be any danger. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
you lean on me, dear child&mdash;little sister that is to be&mdash;and
let me lead you to the house?"</p>

<p>His passion had changed to remorseful gentleness, and
drawing her arm through his he conducted her to Earle
and Norah, who were horrified at learning of the accident.
Precious was taken to her room and a physician summoned.</p>

<p>But beyond the shock and fright Precious suffered no
ill effects from the rattlesnake's venom. Lord Chester's
measures had been quick and effectual, declared the
village doctor.</p>

<p>But Precious kept her room all day, with Norah near
at hand, and only came down at night when Earle begged
her to sit awhile with Lord Chester while he went on an
errand to the village.</p>

<p>Lord Chester was sitting on the long piazza, watching
the beautiful moonlight as it silvered the landscape with
its opal gleams.</p>

<p>He went to meet the girl, and placed her in a chair
where the full flood of moonlight shone on her marvelous
beauty. But he saw that she shrank and trembled at
his nearness.</p>

<p>"You are angry with me," he said humbly, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I owe you my life for the second time. For that I
must be grateful," she murmured faintly.</p>

<p>"Yet you despise me&mdash;because I dared&mdash;almost fearing
you dead&mdash;to press one kiss on your lips."</p>

<p>"You had no right," she faltered, holding her golden
head quite proudly; then, almost inaudibly: "You belong
to Ethel."</p>

<p>There was ineffable sadness in the subdued voice&mdash;sadness
and struggling pride. He whispered thrillingly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Precious, I am not forgetting your sister's claim.
Before I saw you I loved her, but the moment I gazed on
your face&mdash;ay, the mere sight of your portrait&mdash;turned my
heart from her to you. No, let me speak, for I am not disloyal
to Ethel. I mean to keep the troth I plighted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
when I realized that my honor stood pledged to her. But
to-day I was weak, wicked, if you will, for my heart o'er-leaped
control when I met you again. In my love and
grief I went mad over you. But will you forgive me?
Will you let me keep that kiss as a precious memory in
the long years when I shall see you no more? For, dear,
I shall marry your sister and try to give her my heart.
Our home will be far away, in another clime, and I shall
pray Heaven that I never see your face again&mdash;the sweet
face that lured me from queenly Ethel! But, oh, love, if
I had met you first, ere the mournful river sang, 'Too
late! too late!'" and turning quickly from her he went
out into the shadows of the night.</p>

<p>While Lord Chester was fighting his hopeless passion
alone out in the dusk and dew of the summer night, his
friend Earle was undergoing in the village an experience
not entirely dissimilar.</p>

<p>Aura Stanley was peeping through the parlor blinds,
watching to see if her saucy rival next door had any
callers. She murmured curiously:</p>

<p>"Ladybird must be having a party to-night, there are
so many people going in&mdash;only they all seem to be men."</p>

<p>Curiosity overcame Aura's prudence, and stealing into
the Conways' gate she hid herself in the screen of vines
over the pretty bay window looking into the parlor.</p>

<p>She peered curiously through the lace curtains, and
barely escaped betraying herself by a loud cry.</p>

<p>She beheld in the pretty little parlor thirteen young
men&mdash;Ladybird's "baker's dozen" of lovers&mdash;some sitting,
some standing, some conversing, but all with an uneasy
air of expectancy.</p>

<p>"What can they want, all together?" she mused curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Ladybird entered and stood smiling
among her guests.</p>

<p>Never had the bewitching little fairy looked more
charming.</p>

<p>She wore a soft white gown in the empire style, her exquisite
neck and arms half-bared and gleaming through
ruffles of fine white lace.</p>

<p>At her waist was a bunch of white and purple lilacs,
breathing the sweetness and freshness of the spring. Her
only ornament was a light gold chain with a small heart-shaped
locket.</p>

<p>Aura's jealous gaze, devouring her lovely, piquant
rival, saw in the dainty dimpled hand a bundle of letters,
at which she glanced smilingly as she spoke:</p>

<p>"How good and sweet of you all to come as my messenger
asked you. But I know you're all wondering why I asked
you to come at the same time."</p>

<p>A husky murmur came from several throats, and Aura
saw that they were all getting secretly uneasy.</p>

<p>Ladybird continued in a demure little voice that
trembled with repressed laughter, like the music of an
unseen brook in leafy June:</p>

<p>"I am the laziest girl in the world, gentlemen&mdash;that
is part of the explanation. To-day I received thirteen
letters&mdash;one from each of you&mdash;and each begging for the
favor of an immediate reply. Only think of the labor of
writing so many answers on a warm spring day! So I
thought it would be easier to reply to them personally."</p>

<p>Oh, the tremor of the demure voice, with its ripple of
hushed laughter, the childish <i>diablerie</i> of the amber eyes
beneath their long curling lashes of golden brown!</p>

<p>But there seemed to be a general uneasiness among her
guests as they stood about, listening to the little siren.</p>

<p>She went on calmly, with lowered lids and a rising flush:</p>

<p>"I have here thirteen proposals of marriage&mdash;one from
each of you. It is most flattering to me, for I esteem you
all. You are all heroes except Mr. Winans," with a
naughty bow in Earle's direction. "I like you all, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
there is only one Ladybird, so twelve of you must be
disappointed."</p>

<p>Aura Stanley, from her ambush, heard twelve distinct
sighs, and shook with envious rage.</p>

<p>"The simpletons!" she muttered. "Why don't they
go home? Can't they see that she is just turning them
into ridicule to please her wicked vanity?"</p>

<p>But surprise and curiosity combined kept Ladybird's
lovers standing like statues awaiting the end.</p>

<p>"I wish now that only one of you had jumped in the
river to save me yesterday!" cried Ladybird wistfully.
"Then I would have accepted the hero's offer. Now
there's only one way out of my dilemma."</p>

<p>At their surprised looks the willful girl smiled entrancingly
and murmured:</p>

<p>"You shall all draw lots for me. Mr. Gray, your hat,
please. See, here are thirteen slips of paper&mdash;one with
my name, and twelve blank. You may each draw one
slip. Marriage is a lottery, I've often heard, so this may
turn out as well as any."</p>

<p>It was ridiculous, farcical, but the mischievous elf
seemed in such positive earnest that twelve of her adorers
entered smilingly into the spirit of the novel lottery.</p>

<p>Not so with Earle Winans. He stood aloof, amazed,
insulted, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"There remains only one slip," Ladybird said in a
tremulous voice, and she looked at him.</p>

<p>Earle had drawn near to the door. He turned his
angry eyes on her fair wistful face, and his glance expressed
cold contempt.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I decline," he said haughtily.</p>

<p>"As you please," she answered coolly, and turned over
the remaining strip.</p>

<p>It bore her own name!</p>

<p>When Earle saw that he started forward as though to
retract his rash words and win her yet.</p>

<p>But Ladybird had already turned her back on him, and
shrugging her willful shoulders she laughed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"The prize is left in the bottom, like the evils in Pandora's
box."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the lottery wasn't fair, since Mr. Winans
refused to draw. Let us try it over again!" cried Mark
Gwinn eagerly.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered lightly, but the mirth had
gone out of her voice. It was low and tremulous, for
Ladybird knew now she was vanquished by those grim
sisters, the Fates.</p>

<p>They tried again, and the slip with her name fell to
Jack Tennant.</p>

<p>"I am the most fortunate man in the whole world!"
cried the winner with beaming eyes.</p>

<p>Ladybird laughed merrily and cried out quickly:</p>

<p>"But there is a condition attached to the prize that I
forgot to mention at first. It is that you will have to
wait ten years for me!"</p>

<p>"Ten years is an eternity!" he exclaimed remonstratingly.</p>

<p>"You think so?" she cried saucily. "Then I will not
hold you bound to marry me."</p>

<p>"But I shall hold your promise, Ladybird, for I would
wait twenty years for such a prize!" protested the young
man gallantly.</p>

<p>Every one laughed except Earle Winans. He bowed
coldly to his hostess and withdrew from the room.</p>

<p>The others followed quickly, and the last sound they
heard was Ladybird's gay laughter as she cried out mockingly:</p>

<p>"I invite you all to my wedding with Mr. Tennant ten
years hence!"</p>

<p>They were gone, but Aura lingered, waiting to see
what the whimsical little madcap would do next; no doubt,
though, she would laugh at her victims.</p>

<p>But Ladybird staggered to a sofa and fell upon it with
her face hidden on her arm. Then a low grieved sob
broke the stillness of the room that had so lately echoed
her mocking laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>She had humiliated Earle Winans, punished him as she
had vowed to do in her childish resentment. But was the
triumph sweet?</p>

<p>Aura thought not as she saw the white shoulders
heaving with a storm of smothered sobs.</p>

<p>"She threw Earle's heart away, and now she is sorry,"
thought Aura, and fled back to her home somewhat comforted
by the thought that all was over between Earle and
Miss Conway. She would try to win him now herself
while he was angry with the pretty coquette.</p>

<p>Earle was indeed very angry as he walked slowly toward
his own home, leaving the twinkling village lights behind
him in the distance.</p>

<p>He had received such a cruel shock that he could not
tell whether he loved or hated Ladybird most.</p>

<p>With a heart full of love he had written to her that
morning, asking leave to call that evening for the answer
she had promised when he asked her to wear his ring.</p>

<p>She had answered with one simple little word: "Come."</p>

<p>"And I went for&mdash;what?" he growled furiously to himself;
"to be made a fool of with a dozen other idiots&mdash;puppets
that she pulled with a string!" and he gnashed his
white teeth in rage.</p>

<p>But he knew that he had had his triumph, too. He
had seen her quail momentarily at his proud refusal. He
knew that she was wounded.</p>

<p>"She could not bend Earle Winans' proud spirit, and
that will be a thorn in her pillow to-night," he laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>He sat down inside the Rosemont grounds and bared
his feverish brow to the cool, fragrant night. In the stillness
a whip-poor-will called from a thicket in its eerie
voice, and another replied so near at hand that he started
with an uncanny thrill.</p>

<p>"I shall get the dismals if I stay here," rising impatiently.
"Heigho! I wish I had never come to Rosemont,
never met this romantic little maiden with her silly love-tests
and her abominable coquetries! Well, I am done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
with her forever. But what would my friends all say if
they knew that Earle Winans had been vanquished by a
little village beauty? And how am I to keep it from Lord
Chester?"</p>

<p>He flushed hotly out there in the dark, for he detested
ridicule.</p>

<p>"I must swear Chester to secrecy," he decided. "Ah,
how I wish I had never come down to Virginia! I'll leave
here to-morrow, and go abroad again in a week. That is,"
with a start, "if I am alive to-morrow."</p>

<p>For he had suddenly remembered that at sunrise to-morrow
he was to fight a duel with pistols with Jack
Tennant, who had declined to apologize for his hasty blow
at the picnic.</p>

<p>Ladybird Conway, our little "April's lady," wept
disconsolately some time upon the sofa after Aura Stanley
had glided away. Her willful prank had not succeeded as
she expected, and her young heart was very heavy.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could Earle treat me so coldly?" she sobbed.
"I hate all the others&mdash;silly things. And I wouldn't
marry Jack Tennant to save his life."</p>

<p>She heard the gate-latch click, then a masculine step on
the porch, and started up in a flurry, dashing away her
tears.</p>

<p>"It is Earle coming back to beg me not to have anything
to do with Jack Tennant. Oh, I thought he would
repent! I'll forgive the darling, of course, but&mdash;I'll be
a little haughty just at first!" she thought, her spirits
rising to the point of coquetry.</p>

<p>She stood up expectantly, a pretty dimpling smile on
her rosy lips.</p>

<p>In another moment a man stood at the threshold of the
open door&mdash;a tall handsome man past middle age, with
many gray threads in his dark hair.</p>

<p>Ladybird looked at the intruder, then flew to his arms
with a cry of delight:</p>

<p>"Dear papa, you have come at last!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last, my pet!" and Bruce Conway hugged her
with fervor, then drew her to a seat by him on the sofa.</p>

<p>"You have been well, my Ladybird, I see&mdash;you are
blooming as a rose. And where is good Aunt Prue?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nodding in the dining-room, I expect. She
always nods after tea, you know. Well, you have been away
almost six weeks, you naughty papa."</p>

<p>"You have not missed me, I'm sure, for I find you sitting
alone in the parlor, and as fine as a peacock, like a
young lady expecting her beau. Were you?"</p>

<p>He pinched the blushing cheek and laughed mischievously
as she affirmed:</p>

<p>"No, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it. I don't want any young fellow to
carry you off from me for ages yet."</p>

<p>Miss Prudence Primrose entered presently and Bruce
Conway rose with unaffected pleasure to greet this distant
relative, a kindly old Quakeress that he had induced to
come and live with Ladybird after he brought her home
from her Virginia boarding-school.</p>

<p>But the old lady did not quite approve of the wildness of
the prankish girl, and when she was alone with Bruce
that night she said:</p>

<p>"Ladybird is asleep by now, so I must tell thee that
thee art spoiling thy daughter, Bruce. She is too pretty
and willful for her own good."</p>

<p>Bruce Conway smiled in a graceful, indolent way he
had.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Aunt Prue; there is no harm in being
pretty, and she has always been an obedient child."</p>

<p>"But she is so young, Bruce, and she has lovers by the
dozen. They call her the village belle. I don't like it."</p>

<p>"She's only amusing herself, the little wild bird. It's
pleasant to be pretty and popular. I don't suppose she
has an idea of marrying any of those dozen lovers," laughed
Bruce carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's one&mdash;she says she likes him best of all;
but I don't know if she means it, she is so teasing. His
name is Earle Winans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Earle Winans!" and the languid, elegant gentleman
started up, alert and eager. "Earle Winans!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is his name. His father is a great statesman,
and his mother owns Rosemont. He is very rich, this
young man, and very much in love with our Ladybird."</p>

<p>"Ah!" and he rose and crossed over to the window
with his face averted. She thought him careless of the
subject, but he was thinking excitedly:</p>

<p>"So our life-paths cross again after long years in this
strange fashion! Her son in love with my daughter!"</p>

<p>He was stirred in a most subtle fashion.</p>

<p>Long years ago, when Mrs. Winans was a fair young girl,
Bruce Conway had loved her with all the passion of his
young manhood.</p>

<p>His young wife who had died had been Mrs. Winans'
dearest friend.</p>

<p>How like a sequel of fate it seemed that their two
children should love and wed!</p>

<p>The idea pleased Bruce Conway. It was a recompense
for all the sufferings of the past; it was romantic to the
last degree.</p>

<p>He did not rest well that night. The revival of the past
made him restless and nervous. His sleep was haunted by
restless dreams, and at daydawn he was awake after a
most unrefreshing night.</p>

<p>Going out for a walk he soon stood by the side of the
flowing river, his eyes fixed on the eastern sky now glowing
with the rose and gold of dawn. Suddenly a shaft of
fiery light pierced the horizon and the glorious orb of day
appeared.</p>

<p>At that moment two pistol shots, fired simultaneously
at some distance away, rang in his ears. He turned about
quickly. At a little distance there was a thick grove of
pines. He ran forebodingly to the spot.</p>

<p>Voices came to his ears. One said pityingly:
"It is a fatal wound. Tennant, you had better fly."</p>

<p>Then the scene of a duel burst on Conway's sight.</p>

<p>Surgeons and seconds were grouped about in a green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
leafy glade. Upon the grass lay Earle Winans, his eyes
closed, his face pale, blood spurting from his breast. He
had fired into the air, but his adversary had not been so
generous.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes a telegram went to Washington
saying that Earle was very ill and wanted his father.</p>

<p>The surgeon had pronounced that life still lingered,
although he believed the wound to be a fatal one. But
he added that to remove the young man to Rosemont, two
miles away, would destroy the last lingering spark of life.
He must be carried on a stretcher to the nearest house,
then medical skill would do all that was possible.</p>

<p>While he talked he had extracted the bullet from Earle's
breast and stanched the flow of blood. He looked up and
saw a stranger by his side, a dark, elegant-looking man
past middle age.</p>

<p>"Doctor Holdsworth, I am Bruce Conway, an old
friend of the Winans family. My home is less than half
a mile away, and almost the nearest to this spot. He
can be taken there if you please," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well," the surgeon answered briefly, and accordingly
Earle was carried gently to the cottage and installed
in Bruce Conway's own room. Ladybird was still asleep,
or she would have gone wild with the horror of seeing
Earle carried into the house on a stretcher, and apparently
dead.</p>

<p>She slept on through all the subdued noise and bustle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
for she had been wakeful last night and sobbed herself to
sleep at last, poor, willful child, so that when she awoke
the sun rode high in the heavens, and Aunt Prue was
tiptoeing about with a very important air.</p>

<p>She came to the bed, took Ladybird's little hands in hers
and said, seriously and anxiously:</p>

<p>"Ladybird, I have bad news for thee, but thee must not
scream out; thee must bear it very bravely and gently.
A man lies wounded in thy father's chamber, and his life
hangs on the slenderest thread. There was a duel at sunrise
this morning between two of thy lovers, Jack Tennant
and Earle Winans. One fired into the air, the other
at his enemy's breast; one fled, the other your father
brought here."</p>

<p>"Earle!" moaned the girl's white lips, and the brown
eyes shut heavily, while the rose-tint fled the dimpled
cheek. Aunt Prue thought she had fainted, but presently
the girlish bosom began to heave beneath its soft white
robe, and Ladybird sobbed:</p>

<p>"My heart is broken!"</p>

<p>"Dear, tell me, did thee have aught to do with this
sad affair? Was it thy fault?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I can't tell. Don't ask me anything,
Auntie Prue. Let me lie here and die of remorse
as I deserve!" sobbed Ladybird hysterically, for she knew
nothing of the cause of the duel and feared that her own
coquetry was at the bottom of it all.</p>

<p>No coaxing could prevail on her to rise, so presently
Aunt Prue had to leave her there sobbing forlornly on her
pillow.</p>

<p>"Perhaps her father can comfort her," thought the
distressed old lady, and went in search of him.</p>

<p>But Bruce Conway had already gone on a mission of
comfort.</p>

<p>Lord Chester asked him to carry the sad news up to
Rosemont.</p>

<p>Conway performed his task as gently as he could, but
Precious of course was greatly shocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>When Conway saw her growing a little calmed under
his entreaties he took leave and returned to the cottage,
praying silently as he went that he might not find Earle
dead as the physician foreboded.</p>

<p>He wished, too, to meet the Winans party when they
arrived. A delicate plan had been maturing in his mind.</p>

<p>Earle was too low to be removed to Rosemont, and of
course his relatives would be anxious to remain with him.
Bruce Conway decided to give up the cottage to them
and remove his own small family to a hotel.</p>

<p>But Senator Winans quickly vetoed the latter plan.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for your kind thoughtfulness, and will
gladly accept your offer, but in return you must accept
the hospitality of Rosemont for yourself and family," he
said, and Conway knew that he was in grave earnest.</p>

<p>He did not refuse, for he saw that acceptance would be
most proper and grateful.</p>

<p>Aunt Prue said that she would remain and help to nurse
the invalid. There was plenty of room for Senator Winans,
his wife and herself, with their servants. Miss Winans
and Lord Chester could go with Bruce and Ladybird up to
the great house.</p>

<p>Ethel was given only one glance at Earle's pallid, sleeping
face, then they hurried her away with Lord Chester to
Rosemont, Mr. Conway to follow later with his daughter.
Mrs. Winans sent by Ethel a message for Norah to bring
Precious to the cottage, then she turned her pale, grave
face on her old friend.</p>

<p>"Lulu left a daughter, and you did not let me know.
Was that kind?" she asked, gently reproachful.</p>

<p>He flushed and stammered:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Winans, forgive me. You were abroad when
Lulu died and I did not have your exact address. I was
very unhappy over the loss of my wife and I neglected
my duty. I took the child to my good relative, Aunt
Prue, and since then my life has been a restless one.
My daughter has spent almost her whole life at boarding-school
until now, when we hope to settle quietly here. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
hope you will give Ladybird a little of the love you gave
her gentle mother."</p>

<p>His voice trembled, and her tender eyes were dim with
tears. She could not speak. But the surgeon had
debarred her from Earle's side for awhile, and presently
she went to seek Ladybird in her room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord Chester and his betrothed, in the Rosemont
carriage, followed by Hetty Wilkins in the wagon
with the trunks, were <i>en route</i> for the great house.</p>

<p>Lord Chester had been amazed at the cold hauteur of
Ethel when she met him at the station.</p>

<p>She had merely inclined her graceful dark head to him
without a word, and kept her slender hand hanging down
by her side.</p>

<p>In the carriage she preserved the same distant demeanor.
Her pale face and proud eyes were turned away from him
toward the window.</p>

<p>Lord Chester regarded her in surprise for several
moments, then asked gently:</p>

<p>"Have I in any way offended you, dear Ethel?"</p>

<p>Then she turned her eyes on his face. They were angry
and accusing, and her voice trembled with anger as she
cried:</p>

<p>"Why did you leave Washington without informing me?
Surely it was my right to know!"</p>

<p>"Surely, Ethel, but I hope that no blame can attach to
me for not seeing you first, as a telegram summoned me in
haste to your brother, and in order to catch the first train
here I had to leave without sending you a line. But I
wrote you yesterday, and had you not left Washington so
soon this morning you would have received it ere this. I
trust this explanation will acquit me in your eyes of all
dereliction from duty."</p>

<p>His voice was cold, almost contemptuous, and his resentment
of anger only stung the haughty beauty to
further insolence.</p>

<p>"Your duty to me ranked before your courtesy to
Earle," she replied perversely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"When may I hope you will forgive me this time if I
promise to wear my chains more slavishly in future?" he
asked, with delicate sarcasm that stung deeply.</p>

<p>"You call your betrothal to me a chain! Perhaps you
would like to be free of your fetters!" flashed the girl.</p>

<span class="i0">"I give thee up&mdash;a better fate<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My warm devotedness was due,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet as I strike thee from my heart<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Has quenched the lambent, holy flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all estranged my heart from thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Lord Chester's pride could scarcely brook Ethel's insolent
arraignment for what she chose to term his failure
in duty. Impatience was one of his faults, and he could
scarcely restrain his indignation. His dark gray eyes
flashed with temper until they looked as black and brilliant
as Ethel's own, and a deep red spot rose to his cheek.</p>

<p>His heart leaped with the impulse to take the haughty
beauty at her word, to be free of the fetters he had forged
for honor's sake.</p>

<p>"Free!" Oh, what a sweet sound the word had in his
ears! Surely Ethel did not dream how sorely she was
tempting him with her resentful sneers. Free! Why,
then, he might woo dainty Precious with her sweet blue
eyes and gentle heart. Oh, what a heaven of happiness
opened before him at the thought!</p>

<p>But he bit his lips and held his peace.</p>

<p>His own inner anxiety to take Ethel at her word only
made him feel more deeply his lack of love for his
betrothed.</p>

<p>"And she loves me, despite her anger. It would not be
honorable to take her at her rash offer," he decided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that keen sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> inherent in noble natures.
Ethel regarded his silence in angry wonder. She chose
to consider it an affront, and said coldly:</p>

<p>"I offered you your freedom. Am I not worthy an
answer?"</p>

<p>Holding his temper sternly in check Lord Chester
answered gravely:</p>

<p>"Ethel, do you understand what you are saying? You
are dismissing me on such slight cause that when your
anger cools you will be surprised at yourself&mdash;surprised,
and&mdash;perhaps a little sorry," and he looked full into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" she cried scornfully, and tossed her head.</p>

<p>He answered quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, sorry; for you love me a little, I think, do you
not? Surely it was not all for gold and rank that you
accepted me."</p>

<p>She knew that it was not, that she had given him all her
fiery heart, but her pride was in arms. That tender appeal
to her love sounded like a taunt.</p>

<p>The hot blood rushed to her cheeks, and her great eyes
flashed with almost insane anger. She cried contemptuously:</p>

<p>"I fancied I loved you once, but a nature like mine
cannot bear neglect and harshness. Your words to me
just now were ill-chosen, and I cannot forgive them.
From this moment I hate you. Take back your freedom
and your ring," and she pressed the costly jewel into his
reluctant hand.</p>

<p>"So I am jilted," laughed the young man harshly.</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken, for the carriage was rolling
up the driveway, to the house. They saw Precious on
the long piazza waiting.</p>

<p>At sight of that beautiful young figure Ethel frowned
heavily, and a qualm of pain shook her proud heart.</p>

<p>"What if he turns to her? But he shall not!" she
thought bitterly.</p>

<p>She just touched his hand in springing from the
carriage, then found Precious clinging about her neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to see you, darling!" she cooed, but
Ethel soon shook her off.</p>

<p>"Don't you see I'm tired to death? Let me go in and
rest. Norah, how are you? By the way, send the housekeeper
to me. We are to have guests&mdash;Lord Chester, Mr.
Conway, and his daughter. Are the guest rooms ready?"</p>

<p>Lord Chester stepped forward, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"It will not be convenient for me to remain at Rosemont,
Miss Winans. I shall go to the village hotel until
my friend Earle is better, then I am going away."</p>

<p>He saw the beautiful dark face turn ashy pale at his
words, but she did not answer, and with a low bow that
included all he walked away.</p>

<p>Ethel's lips half opened as if to call him back, then they
closed again, and Precious cried in dismay:</p>

<p>"Oh, what have you done to Lord Chester? He is
offended."</p>

<p>"I have broken my engagement," answered her proud
sister coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you cruel girl!" cried Precious indignantly, but
Ethel gave her a scathing glance.</p>

<p>"It is no quarrel of yours," she said icily, then to
Norah: "My mother wishes you and Precious to come to
her in the carriage for a short time at Mr. Conway's.
Come, Hetty, I will go to my room," and she swept away
like a queen.</p>

<p>Hetty lingered just long enough to whisper to Norah,
"She's been in a tantrum all day," and followed her
mistress.</p>

<p>"Come, Norah, let us get in the carriage and go at once
to mamma," cried Precious eagerly, and as the carriage
rolled along the village street they passed Lord Chester
striding along very fast toward the hotel. He lifted his
hat to Precious with a glance that made her pulses beat
faster, remembering yesterday and last night.</p>

<p>A quick thought pulsed through her throbbing heart:</p>

<p>"Ethel has broken her engagement. She no longer
loves him. He is free&mdash;free&mdash;to&mdash;love&mdash;me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not say to herself that it was not wrong now for
her to think of him. Love was a shy newcomer in her
heart, too timid yet to own his presence there.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled past and left him, then the young
girl's thoughts turned back to Earle, and the quick tears
sprang to her eyes. When they stopped at the cottage
gate she was sobbing convulsively, against Norah's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Aunt Prue came out to meet them with a very sober
face, and led them upstairs to Ladybird's room. Mrs.
Winans rose with a cry of joy, and clasped her darling in
her arms.</p>

<p>Ladybird, who sat at the window looking very pale and
pretty in a blue morning gown, turned aside with a repressed
sob. Oh, how she envied Precious her sweet and loving
mother, for her own young mother had died when her little
one was born, and her child had never known the sweetness
of maternal love.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Winans thought of this, too, for when she
had kissed and cried over Precious a little she led her forward
to the window, saying tenderly:</p>

<p>"I have found in Ladybird the daughter of the dearest
girl friend I ever had, and we must both love her, Precious,
for her mother's sake."</p>

<p>"I love her already for her own," cried Precious, kissing
Ladybird's white cheek fondly, and a sob rose in the
little coquette's throat as she wondered if they would
love her still if they ever found out how she had treated
Earle, whom they loved so dearly. Alas, she loved him
too&mdash;she realized it more fully now that he lay wounded,
perhaps dying&mdash;and how she hated Jack Tennant, the
man who held the promise of her hand. Why, she would
die before she would marry such a wretch!</p>

<p>The summer night had fallen softly at Rosemont, and
all were asleep save the beautiful sisters in whose hearts
burned the restless fire of love.</p>

<p>Precious was alone in her airy white room, with the
fragrant breeze straying into her windows with the moonlight&mdash;the
moonlight so clear and white that Precious
could read by its silvery rays the letter Bruce Conway had
given her clandestinely to-day.</p>

<p>It was from Lord Chester, and Precious had read it a
dozen times before she retired and placed it beneath her
pillow.</p>

<p>She lay there all lovely and restless in the moonlight,
her whole being flooded with a shy, ecstatic rapture over
her first love-letter. At last she lifted the golden head
and slipped the little white hand under the pillow, and
drew it out to read again.</p>

<p>Lord Chester had written impulsively:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My darling little Precious, you remember <i>that</i> day, <i>that</i> night!
I feared you hated me for my boldness, and I have not dared to
venture near you since! But my heart urges me to write, for I am
<i>free</i> now&mdash;Ethel has jilted me&mdash;and my irrepressible love for you
is no longer a wrong to your sister. Ah, Precious, will you let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
love you&mdash;will you love me in return? My heart is thrilling with a
mad hope of success, for something tells me you will be mine!
To-morrow evening I shall call on you to know my fate. Ah, love;
love, love, be kind to me, for unless I win you for my worshiped
bride the world will be a great dreary blank to me, and life not worth
the living. Ah, Precious, the kiss I took that day when you lay
senseless in my arms burns on my lips still. You were angry, and
I could not blame you. Perhaps it only made it worse when I confessed
that evening all my hopeless love for you. But I meant no
wrong; I was leaving you forever! Ah, how changed is everything!
I am glad Ethel found out she did not love me and broke our bonds
of her own free will. Now she will not care for our love, now you
will forgive me, now you will promise to be mine, will you not, my
little darling?</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Arthur.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The happy blue eyes wandered lovingly over the tender
words, and then Precious kissed the letter and placed it
again beneath the pillow. Then she started, as a shadow
fell across the bed.</p>

<p>It was Ethel, tall and white and spirit-like, hovering over
her in the flood of white moonlight.</p>

<p>"Sister!" cried Precious in surprise, then with a swift
fear: "Oh, what has happened? Earle?"</p>

<p>"There is no bad news of Earle. Do not be frightened,
dear," and Ethel knelt down by the white bed, crying
shudderingly: "Oh, Precious, I am so unhappy I shall die
unless I find some comfort!"</p>

<p>Her face was convulsed with pain. Some burning tears
fell on the younger girl's cheek as Ethel leaned above her,
sobbing wildly, her pallid face half-hidden by the long veil
of dark, flowing tresses.</p>

<p>She felt white arms reach out and draw her close; warm
lips kissed the burning tears from her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah, Ethel, I know, I understand, for I heard to-day,"
whispered Precious fondly. "You think he loves me
best&mdash;papa, I mean. But, Ethel, no, it is not that. I will
tell you how it is. He loves me because I have mamma's
face&mdash;mamma whom he worships so tenderly. Ethel, do
not let it grieve you. He loves you well, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, child, you madden me!" cried Ethel hoarsely.
She was silent a moment, then resumed passionately:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Precious, you pretend to love me, and now I will prove
your love. All your life you have robbed me with those
sunny blue eyes of the love that should have been mine.
Do you wish to atone, to press all this jealous anger from
my breast and make me happy again? Then I will tell
you how. You know that I have lost my lover, that I discarded
him rashly, unjustly, in pride and anger. He is too
proud to sue for a reconciliation, yet I cannot live without
him. It was jealous madness that made me throw him
over, and now I repent my folly, I yearn to be reconciled
to my darling."</p>

<p>Her burning hand clasped her sister's icy fingers.</p>

<p>"He loves me, I know he loves me, but he is too proud
to come back to me unless I send for him. And I&mdash;oh, I
am proud, too; I would fain be forgiven without the asking!
Oh, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Precious sat upright with her
elbow on the pillow. It seemed to her that she could hear
beneath it her lover's letter rustling like a live thing under
her touch, like a human heart. Words failed her, she was
speechless with a hovering despair.</p>

<p>Ethel flung back the heavy masses of her rich black hair
from her pale, convulsed face, crying wildly:</p>

<p>"Don't let me frighten you, Precious, but I must confide
in you or my heart will break. Oh, what a night of
anguish I have spent! Not a moment have I slept, and all
the while suffering anguish inconceivable in my bitter
jealousy of another girl."</p>

<p>She saw the wild start that Precious gave, and continued:</p>

<p>"They tell me Arthur is calling on another girl&mdash;a dark-eyed
beauty down in the village. It is only in pique, I
know; but what if this Aura Stanley wins him from me?
Hearts are often caught in the rebound, they say. Oh,
Precious, how I should hate any girl that won Arthur's
heart from me! I should hate her, and in my despair and
jealousy I would be certain to commit suicide."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, sister!" cried Precious, horrified; but Ethel
persisted wildly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be sure to do it, for I could not lose my love
and live. But I will not give him up. He is mine, mine,
and he must forgive me and come back to me."</p>

<p>Precious saw the great dark eyes flash luridly, and shuddered
with the consciousness of the love-letter under her
pillow.</p>

<p>"You can help me, Precious," cried Ethel coaxingly.
"You can send for Lord Chester to come to you. You
are such a child still that it will not seem strange for you
to plead your sister's cause with him. You can tell him
all I have confessed to you&mdash;my love, my jealousy, my
repentance. You can beg him to return to me and save
my heart from breaking. Will you do this for me, my
little sister? Then we shall be at peace with each other."</p>

<p>Lord Chester had come up to Rosemont with Bruce
Conway, and finding Precious waiting for him, had asked
her to walk with him by the river.</p>

<p>He had a romantic longing to plight his vows of love
beneath the silent stars, beside the whispering waters, where
he had first kissed Precious, his heart's darling.</p>

<p>He drew the trembling little hand fondly within his
arm, and they walked along several minutes in that silence
so dear to lovers, each heart thrilling with the nearness of
the beloved one. The moon silvered the graveled path they
were walking, and the soft breeze blew to his senses the
fragrance of the knot of violets Precious wore at her white
throat.</p>

<p>The walk to the river seemed very short and perilously
sweet. They paused in the shadow of a tree and suddenly,
ere Precious realized his intention, Lord Chester clasped
her in his arms, and kissed her lips.</p>

<p>"My own Precious, my beautiful darling!" he murmured,
holding her close, and kissing again and again the
lovely face, not realizing at first that she was shrinking
from him, trying to struggle out of his arms.</p>

<p>He was not a vain man, but somehow he had been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
sure that Precious returned his love; it had seemed to him
that they were made for each other.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God made two souls in Paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of air and fire and dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then oped the morning's crystal gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And let them wander through."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It seemed to the young lover that God had created himself
and Precious twin souls. They belonged to each other,
and neither could desire to escape so sweet a fate.</p>

<p>He had quite forgotten the beautiful belle for whom he
had cherished a fleeting fancy. The passion of a lifetime had
swept across his soul like a wave upon the shore, obliterating
all other things, and as he clasped and kissed the girl
beneath the watching stars it seemed to him that the whole
universe contained only God, Precious, and himself.</p>

<p>It was a moment of the purest rapture, the most ecstatic
bliss; it was so exquisite it touched the border line of pain.</p>

<p>That girlish, budding form in the circle of his tender
arms, that golden head on his shoulder, that lovely face
beneath his lips, her warm breath and the odor of the
violets at her throat blending together, it was intoxicating,
divine.</p>

<p>"My little bride that is to be," he whispered; but a
frightened sob replied to him; she writhed herself out of
his clasping arms.</p>

<p>"Have I startled you, my Precious? Ah, forgive me,
little angel," he cried eagerly, and added: "You received
my letter, Precious? You know how much I love you!
Do you love me a little in return? May I speak to your
father to-morrow, and tell him that it is Precious, not
Ethel, who is to be my bonny bride?"</p>

<p>Ah, Heaven, the sweetness of that wooing voice, the
glorious beauty of that face smiling down on her, the
heaven of love in those eager, extended arms! Her tender
heart went out to him with passionate yearning to grant
his prayer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To grow, live, die, looking on his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Die, dying, clasped in his embrace!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a moment she could not speak. She leaned back
dizzily against the tree with her half-shut eyes upon his
face&mdash;leaned there silently, and heard the night breeze
sighing over her head, the river lapsing at her feet,
whispering over and over to her heart, "Regret! Regret!
Regret!"</p>

<p>He would have taken her hand, but she waved him
back.</p>

<p>"Precious, speak to me," he urged. "Why are you so
strange? Has my impulsiveness offended you? I pray
you forgive me."</p>

<p>She answered, in a low and hollow voice:</p>

<p>"Listen to the river. It is saying again and again
those words you heard that day, 'Too late! Too late!'"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, my love, they are different now. Listen how
clear and distinct the words, 'Love! Love! Love!'"</p>

<p>But she did not smile; he saw her shudder and draw
back as he advanced to her side.</p>

<p>A sudden dreadful thought came over him like an icy
chill. He faltered:</p>

<p>"Can it be I have been over-confident? Am I mistaken
in believing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes&mdash;a great mistake!" she breathed faintly,
just loud enough for him to catch the words.</p>

<p>He stood like one stunned, the hope and joy fading from
his eyes, his heart sinking with despair.</p>

<p>Then he found his voice, and cried hoarsely:</p>

<p>"I must be going mad. I was as sure of your love, as
sure of my happiness, as I am that God reigns in heaven.
Do you mean that you do not love me, that you cannot
marry me?"</p>

<p>"Never! never!"</p>

<p>"Child, child, you cannot be so cruel! Ah, give me a
little hope to live on! Say you will try to love me. Let
me teach you love's sweet lesson. Let me plead to you!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no, no! Let me plead to you, Arthur&mdash;nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Lord Chester!" and suddenly she was on her knees, at his
feet, her white face uplifted in the moonlight, the burning
tears upon her cheeks. Wild words came from the pale,
writhing lips&mdash;startling words full of Ethel's repentance
and Ethel's prayer for pardon.</p>

<p>"You are not free, you dare not love another lest Ethel's
despair blight your happiness. Go back to her, forgive
her, and the old love will return," she sobbed.</p>

<p>He had listened in terrified silence to every word. Now
he took her hands and lifted her gently to her feet.</p>

<p>"Do not kneel to me, little saint," he said sadly, and
looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>They could not meet his. The long lashes drooped and
shadowed her cheek. Then he asked gently:</p>

<p>"Would you build Ethel's happiness on the wreck of
yours and mine, my darling?"</p>

<p>"You must not call me your darling, you must not
think of me. I am only a child, she says, too young to
know what love is like. So," wearily, "you see there is
no question of me. It is only you and Ethel&mdash;two lovers
who have quarreled, and must make it up again."</p>

<p>"Never! never!" he cried angrily. "She released me
of her own free will&mdash;flung me off in scorn."</p>

<p>"She repents! She prays you to return! Oh, Arthur,
go!"</p>

<p>"You can send me back to her! Ah, then, indeed, I
dreamed a vain dream. You never loved me, never!"</p>

<p>"Go then, for pity's sake, return to unhappy Ethel, and
save her heart from breaking!" she sobbed miserably.</p>

<p>"And sacrifice my own!" he muttered, in the hoarse
tones of despair.</p>

<p>She saw him stoop down a moment. A sob shook her
frame as he gathered the violets that had fallen from her
throat, and placed them in his breast. Then he looked at
her, saying:</p>

<p>"You can do this horrible thing&mdash;send me from you
with this tortured heart to another? Then, indeed, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
must be a child as she says. You cannot know the
strength and the madness of love!"</p>

<p>"Go back to Ethel! It is my one prayer to you, Lord
Chester," she faltered imploringly.</p>

<p>"Then I will go. May God forgive you, Precious," and
he hurried away.</p>

<p>Ethel had seen them go. At last, unable to restrain
her impatience, she followed them halfway to the river.
She met Lord Chester returning alone.</p>

<p>Ethel stood still, looking at Arthur with her whole soul
in her dark, passionate eyes.</p>

<p>He struggled with his feelings for a moment, then the
pain and imploring in her face won his pity. He took
her hand, whispering gently:</p>

<p>"Dear Ethel!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, you forgive me!" she panted, and leaned
her regal head against his shoulder.</p>

<p>The humility of the proud girl won for her more than
all her pride could have done&mdash;his pitying regard. He
put his arm tenderly about her, and held her close for a
moment, and he could never tell why she lifted her head
so suddenly and drew back in silent pain.</p>

<p>As she leaned against him the odor of crushed violets
came to her with sickening sweetness&mdash;violets, her sister's
favorite flowers. She had seen Precious wearing them
awhile ago, and she guessed that now they were hidden
on Lord Chester's breast. She would hate them now all
her life, those purple-blue globes of elusive sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>But she dared not give voice to her jealous pain. She
could only smile up in his face and murmur:</p>

<p>"You forgive me, dear? You will love me again?"</p>

<p>"Everything shall be as it was before," he answered,
and kissed her lips&mdash;not such kisses as he had given
Precious just now, but a light caress, one that she knew
was a duty kiss.</p>

<p>A bitter sigh burst from her lips, and she felt for a
moment as if she would like to fall down dead at his feet
in her shame and humiliation over the poor victory she had
won.</p>

<p>But he was speaking again, gravely, quietly:</p>

<p>"Let me take you to the house, Ethel, for I must leave
you very soon. I must go back to Washington to-night."</p>

<p>"But why so soon?" she pouted, and he answered:</p>

<p>"I had letters from England to-day, calling me home
at once. There is something gravely wrong, but neither
the lawyer nor my father, the earl, gave me any particulars,
only they said I must come as soon as possible."</p>

<p>He paused, touched by the gasping sob on her lips.</p>

<p>"Do not take it so hard, Ethel, dear. I will write
often, and return long before the date of our marriage
this winter. Meanwhile I will be making soft my English
nest for my beautiful bride. But I am very curious over
the matter that has called me home, and I shall be in New
York to-morrow, and sail on the first ship."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"THE WINDS OF FATE BLOW EVER."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all that life can teach us,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The winds of Fate blow ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But ever blow amiss!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The days fled fast, and brought the balm of hope to
aching hearts.</p>

<p>Contrary to the surgeon's verdict, and in spite of a very
dangerous wound, Earle Winans was on the road to
recovery.</p>

<p>Youth, health, and a superb constitution had triumphed
over the circumstances that threatened the close of his
young, promising life.</p>

<p>But it was quite three weeks, and far into the middle of
June, before he was able to be removed from the Conway
cottage up to Rosemont.</p>

<p>In the meantime something had happened that caused
Ladybird's exile from the scene of her mischievous
triumphs and coquetries.</p>

<p>The story of her novel lottery the night after the picnic
had become public property in the village and shared
usual notoriety with the duel.</p>

<p>Nothing was talked of but the rivalry between Aura
and Ladybird that had been the primary cause of the duel.
It became the sensation of the hour. The gaping of the
villagers when either of the rival beauties appeared on the
streets was so unendurable that even the bold-eyed Aura
shrank with dismay, and was fain to remain indoors,
although the giving up of her designs on Earle Winans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
was succeeded by the vaulting ambition to become Lady
Chester.</p>

<p>Arthur did indeed call once on the lawyer's daughter,
but she made no impression on the heart that already held
a fairer image. But he was curious to know the girl who
had been the cause of the duel. When he had satisfied his
curiosity and laughed in his sleeve over her wasted airs
and graces, he retreated from the field, and none of her
efforts could inveigle him inside her doors again.</p>

<p>The story of Ladybird's flirtations was well known to
everybody else before it reached her father and the Winans
family.</p>

<p>Bruce Conway was one of the proudest of men, and
although he had been an accomplished flirt in his own day
he could not tolerate it in his daughter. The truth
horrified him.</p>

<p>If it had been any other girl than Ladybird, his own
lovely daughter, he would have laughed in his idle, graceful
way at her novel method of doing justice to her lovers,
the "heroes," as she termed them&mdash;but this came home
too nearly.</p>

<p>He recalled with a groan his pleasant hopes and fancies
built on his daughter's preference for Earle Winans. Then
he muttered:</p>

<p>"Engaged to a fellow I never saw! A village lawyer's
clerk! That Jack Tennant! Won in a lottery&mdash;my
daughter! Good heavens! how careless and thoughtless I
have been, taking my own way and letting Ladybird take
hers. Otherwise this never could have happened."</p>

<p>For the most of his life Bruce Conway had taken things
easily, and life had gone easy with him, but here was
something that shook him up, as it were.</p>

<p>He had a long talk with Miss Prudence Primrose, during
which she said so often, "I told thee so, Bruce, I told thee
so," that it almost drove him mad.</p>

<p>"But what can I do with her? How restrain her in the
future, even if she ever lives down the notoriety of this
ridiculous prank?" he groaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Prue sighed helplessly, then a bright thought came
to her, and she suggested:</p>

<p>"Why not consult my good friend, Mrs. Winans? She
has raised up two gentle daughters very properly."</p>

<p>"No, Prue, I cannot consult Mrs. Winans. You forget
how shamefully Ladybird has treated her son. If it comes
to her ears, as it must, she will resent the indignity to her
son, who inherits all his father's pride and nobility. The
affection she cherishes for Ladybird now will perhaps
change into disgust. I cannot tell what to do with the
little madcap, but I can tell you, Aunt Prue, a widower
with a coquettish daughter on his hands is an object to be
pitied."</p>

<p>Miss Prue did not pity him much. She thought he had
neglected his pretty, motherless child all along, and valued
his own ease too highly. Now he was reaping the fit
reward for his carelessness.</p>

<p>"I will send her to a convent school till she's twenty,
that's what I'll do," he declared irritably.</p>

<p>But suddenly Ladybird took the matter into her own
hands.</p>

<p>The little beauty had been secretly very unhappy ever
since the night when her willful prank had so deeply
offended Earle's proud heart and reared that wall of ice
between them.</p>

<p>Up at Rosemont every one believed her perfectly happy,
and none dreamed of her love and sorrow over Earle, who
might die and never forgive her for the wrong she had
done him.</p>

<p>Everyone loved and petted her, from the stately senator
and his lovely daughters down to the lowest menial on the
grand estate. As for gentle Mrs. Winans, she had a deep
and silent love, maternal in its strength, for the winsome
child of her dear dead friend, bonny Lulu.</p>

<p>Ladybird knew well how they loved her, and her heart
thrilled with love for them, but always there was the
haunting thought that when Earle should tell them of her
coquettish wiles they would despise her ever after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that would break my heart," she sighed tearfully.</p>

<p>So when Earle was declared out of danger she began to
shrink at the very thought of meeting him again. The
memory of his last proud look of resentful scorn remained
always in her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I should like to run away. I can never meet him
again, cold and altered, loving me no longer," she sobbed
on her pillow that night.</p>

<p>And as if in answer to her longing wish a letter came
next morning.</p>

<p>It was the next day after her father had declared to Miss
Prue that he would place her in a convent school for three
years.</p>

<p>She went to him with a smile, her heart beating with
hope, and placed the letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ladybird?"</p>

<p>"A letter, papa, from my old schoolmistress, Madame
Hartman. She and her husband are going abroad in a
week for a summer tour, and they take with them our
whole graduated class of last year&mdash;ten girls, you know,
counting me. She has written to ask if you will permit
me to join her party. Will you, papa, dearest?" clinging
fondly round his neck. "She chaperoned ten girls abroad
last year, and they had such a lovely time&mdash;lovely! And if
I go I must join madame in Richmond this week."</p>

<p>"You take my breath away, Ladybird, this is so
sudden."</p>

<p>"But you will let me go. My heart is quite set on it,
papa."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, I had hoped to have you for my guest
this summer," said Mrs. Winans, who happened to be
present.</p>

<p>"I thank you, but&mdash;I would not like to disappoint
Madame Hartman," Ladybird murmured, with a break in
her voice.</p>

<p>"Then you must be my guest in Washington this winter.
I should like to present you to Washington society at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
time that Precious comes out. Will you consent, Mr.
Conway?"</p>

<p>"Gladly," he answered, and Ladybird went over to kiss
the lovely, gentle face, and left a tear on Mrs. Winans'
cheek. She did not guess it was for her son's sake.</p>

<p>Bruce Conway was too much pleased with Madame
Hartman's opportune offer to decline it, so it was accepted
by telegraph, and her father took her to Richmond next
day to join her kind teacher. The Winans family saw her
go, with loving regrets and confident hopes of a meeting
next fall, forgetting how adversely the winds of fate too
often blow.</p>

<p>In due time Ethel received a letter from Lord Chester,
announcing his safe arrival in England.</p>

<p>But to her surprise and chagrin the young man made
no mention of the mysterious matter that had called him
away.</p>

<p>"Can it be that Arthur deceived me? That he
invented an excuse to get away from me? What if he
means to break his troth?" she thought, with instant,
angry suspicion.</p>

<p>But when she noticed how pale her sister's young cheek
had grown while she read her letter, she smoothed the
frown from her brow and cried out gayly:</p>

<p>"Ah, Precious, I wish you had an adoring lover like
mine! It would thrill your heart to read some of the
tender passages in dear Arthur's letter."</p>

<p>She read aloud, blushingly, some tender words and
phrases, but the blush was for her own falsehood, for
Arthur's letter held nothing like what she read. It was
brief and almost indifferent, and the poor fellow had tried
to excuse its coldness by pleading haste.</p>

<p>If Precious was surprised at those ardent words of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
to her sister, she was also glad in her tender, unselfish
heart that Arthur had returned to his first love. She
crushed down her own bitter pangs and answered sweetly:</p>

<p>"I am glad that he loves you so dearly, Ethel!"</p>

<p>In the quiet months at Rosemont, Precious had recovered
from the nervous prostration that had followed upon the
horror of her kidnaping by Lindsey Warwick, and the
subsequent escape from the haunted house. The failure
to apprehend the villain had made every one believe he
was a fugitive far away. So the careful guard over the
young girl had relaxed its vigilance, and she wandered at
her own sweet will about the pretty ornamental grounds
surrounding the house.</p>

<p>One evening she wandered at twilight down to the river
bank toward the spot where she had parted with Lord
Chester that fateful night. She stood beneath the wide-spreading
oak with the first faint rays of the moon on her
face, and the river murmuring at her feet.</p>

<p>The true and tender little heart was very heavy, despite
all her efforts to be brave and strong; and although she
had sent Arthur back to Ethel so nobly she could not
banish him yet from her sorrowful thoughts.</p>

<p>With half-shut eyes and two burning tears on her pale
cheeks, Precious stood still, living over in fancy the thrilling
moment when Arthur had clasped and kissed her, and
claimed her for his own.</p>

<p>Precious loved the young hero who had saved her life
with all the passion of her soul, and her fond heart was
breaking for his loss.</p>

<p>"But he can never be mine&mdash;never!" she sobbed faintly,
and the river's voice echoed the plaintive words:</p>

<p>"Never! Never!"</p>

<p>Absorbed in her own sad thoughts, Precious did not
catch the faint sound of footsteps creeping nearer and
nearer, did not dream that this was the opportunity long
waited and desired by a sinister intruder. Her downcast
gaze did not see the tall form gliding round the tree,
nor the burning eyes whose gaze seemed to scorch her
face!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly a shawl was thrown over her head, stifling
her shriek of surprise and horror, two strong arms closed
around her form, and in another moment Precious would
have been borne away a helpless captive to a dreadful fate;
but at that moment Earle Winans, who had followed
Precious, came opportunely upon the scene.</p>

<p>He beheld with horror the attempted outrage, and lifting
a cane he carried struck the wretch a blow that made
him reel and drop the girl's inanimate form on the
ground.</p>

<p>There was an oath from the foiled villain, but Earle's
hands were about his throat, forcing him to his knees.</p>

<p>"You hound! How dare you touch my sister?" thundered
Earle, and the wretch whined as well as he could
for the clutch on his throat:</p>

<p>"Your sister, sir? Oh, a thousand pardons! I thought
it was my sweetheart, Hetty Wilkins, the maid of Miss
Winans. We were courting here under the tree, and she
sent me up to the servants' entrance to bring her shawl.
In play only I threw it over her head, to give her a fright!
It was a mistake. I beg your and the lady's pardon, and
if you will let me go I'll never intrude on the grounds
again!"</p>

<p>The story was so plausible, the wretch's abject terror so
pitiable, that Earle permitted him to sneak away, little
dreaming that it was the veritable Lindsey Warwick he
had held in his grasp&mdash;the detestable villain who, under
the guise of Hetty's lover, was still pursuing the mad
purpose of winning the senator's beautiful daughter, who
was as far above him as the stars from the earth.</p>

<p>He slunk away, and Earle knelt down by Precious,
drawing the shawl from her white, unconscious face.</p>

<p>"Darling, speak to me!" he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>She shuddered, and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, is it you?" clinging to him distractedly.
One fearful glance around her, and she moaned:</p>

<p>"Where is Lindsey Warwick? He came upon me suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and as I shrieked and turned to fly he threw a shawl
over my head and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lindsey Warwick! Is it possible? and I have let the
wretch escape! Come, darling, to the house, that I may
pursue the villain!" Earle cried in bitter anger and chagrin
that he had been so easily duped.</p>

<p>But though Senator Winans, with his son and a dozen
other men, followed the trail all night, the search was
hopeless, for Lindsey Warwick cleverly eluded capture.</p>

<p>And through the long night hours the mother watched
by the bedside of the nervous girl, who tossed restlessly
upon her pillow, starting in alarm at every sound, and
begging piteously to be taken away from Rosemont.</p>

<p>"We will go to-morrow, dear," Mrs. Winans promised
tenderly.</p>

<p>Hetty Wilkins wept and protested when she was told the
story of the man who claimed to be her lover.</p>

<p>"There is some mistake," she cried. "My young man's
name is Watson Hunter. And he wasn't here to-night at
all."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Winans insisted on dismissing Hetty next day,
with a month's wages in lieu of a warning. This plan
seemed best to them all.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Hetty Wilkins was bitterly grieved at her dismissal
from the service of Mrs. Winans, and her vanity was
wounded by the suggestion that Lindsey Warwick had been
courting her simply to keep up with the movements of the
Winans family and further his own designs.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, madam, he cannot be the same man, I'm
sure," she declared stubbornly.</p>

<p>"But, Hetty, there can be no mistake. My daughter
recognized him, and he declared to my son that he was
your lover. Now, my good girl, there is a reward of ten
thousand dollars offered by Senator Winans for Lindsey
Warwick's apprehension. Suppose you earn it by delivering
this wretch up to justice," suggested Mrs. Winans,
very much in earnest over the matter.</p>

<p>So Hetty departed, angry at her dismissal, and firm in
the belief that her lover was innocent of the charges
brought against him.</p>

<p>But when Watson Hunter came no more, and her letters
to him elicited no reply, her loving confidence grew faint,
and suspicion awakened in her mind.</p>

<p>"I will find him if I have to employ a detective," she
vowed spitefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>But for Hetty's strong faith in fortune-tellers, it is
likely that her absconding lover might have eluded her forever,
but when a month had passed in futile efforts she
suddenly bethought herself of invoking the aid of a clairvoyant
in her search for the truant.</p>

<p>She had returned to Washington several weeks before,
and it was now the middle of August. On consulting the
papers she selected from the advertisements one in a very
obscure locality, and made her way thither without delay.
The mind-reader and clairvoyant, as she called herself,
was located on a dirty little street in a villainous-looking
tobacco shop. When Hetty entered, the slovenly-looking
old woman was serving a customer with cigars, and the
maid was startled to find in her the same woman to whom
she had once advised Ethel to apply.</p>

<p>"I want my fortune told," she said in an undertone to
the woman.</p>

<p>"Come into the back room, then, and I'll send my son
to wait on the shop."</p>

<p>With her pretty nose in the air, at the vile odors of the
place, the smart maid followed into the back room, where
a slovenly man with long hair and full whiskers was making
some drawings at a little table.</p>

<p>"You must wait on the shop while I tell the young
lady's fortune," the woman said to him, and he rose with
a muttered word of impatience.</p>

<p>Hetty was not the least interested in the gruff man, and
she scarcely knew why she cast a searching glance upon
him.</p>

<p>But when she looked at him she met a glance of startled
recognition that made her foolish heart leap with wild excitement.
The next moment she clutched his arm, crying
sobbingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Watson, Watson, so I've found you at last!"</p>

<p>"The devil!" cried Lindsey Warwick, trying to shake
her off, for his first impulse was to snatch his hat and run.</p>

<p>But Hetty clasped his neck with both arms, and clung
to him like a wild-cat, despite his struggles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go! let me go! I don't know you! I'm a
stranger to you&mdash;that isn't my name!" he vociferated
wildly. "Mother, take her off and hold her, won't you?"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the old woman come to his relief, and
soon had the pretty maid a prisoner in her own strong
arms.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you little crazy wild-cat?"
she demanded roughly, but Hetty was gazing
malignantly at Warwick, who regarded her with an injured
air.</p>

<p>"Young woman, you've made a mistake. I don't
know you!" he was saying.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I, Mr. Lindsey Warwick?" cried Hetty, taking
revenge for her slighted love. "Maybe that ain't your
name, neither! Maybe I don't intend to scream for the
police, and give you up to them, and claim the reward, you
villain!"</p>

<p>She was opening her mouth for a prolonged shriek, when
a hand was clapped over it, and Lindsey Warwick cried
out laughingly:</p>

<p>"You silly darling, can't you take a joke? Of course
my name isn't Warwick, but Watson Hunter, and I was
only teasing you a little to pay you back for running off
from Rosemont and leaving me in the lurch."</p>

<p>Hetty gasped in his clutch and he loosened it gently,
seeing that his falsehoods had begun to bewilder and soften
her angry mood.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you write to me when you left Rosemont?"
continued the arch deceiver. "I was down there a day
or two after the family packed up to leave, and I thought
you had gone away with them and given me the jilt. But
you won't get away from me again, for we'll go to the
preacher this very day, won't we, dearie?"</p>

</div></div>


<p>The golden summer days fled fast, and the Winans
family remained at Rosemont until they were to go to
their Washington home to make ready for Ethel's marriage
early in December.</p>

<p>Lord Chester had not yet returned to America, as the
lawsuit was not decided yet, but the date of the marriage
remained unaltered, for Ethel had indignantly disclaimed
any desire to break her engagement because of the altered
prospects of her betrothed.</p>

<p>So while they rested at Rosemont they had much to look
forward to in the near future, only they talked of it but
little, for each had secret sorrows that weighed heavily on
their hearts. Precious had one in the inability to tear
from her mind the thought of the man so soon to become
her sister's husband, and Earle had one of the same character
in his stifled love for willful Ladybird, who had used
him so cruelly. Senator Winans was pained because he
was so soon to lose his elder daughter, and his wife, while
she shared this sorrow, had another grief very near her
gentle heart.</p>

<p>In the forty years of life that had passed over her golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
head in mingled sunshine and shadow the senator's lovely,
graceful wife had never been known to turn traitor to a
friendship, or to shirk a duty, however hard. In her
noble nature all the elements of constancy and self-sacrifice
were exquisitely blended to form a model woman,
whether in prosperity or adversity.</p>

<p>So it was not strange that her peculiar interest in Ladybird
Conway had drawn her maternal instincts strongly
toward the capricious but adorable little beauty.</p>

<p>Her interest in the young girl dated back to her
parents.</p>

<p>Bruce Conway had been Grace's first lover, and it is
said that a woman's heart always retains a slight tenderness
for the lover who was first to worship at her shrine.</p>

<p>On the other hand the girl Bruce Conway had married
claimed Mrs. Winans as her dearest friend, and it was
through her that little Earle, when kidnaped by a poor
mother crazed by the loss of her own child, had been
restored to his parents. Now, when gentle, brown-eyed
Lulu had been dead for years, her memory was still green
in the heart of this true friend, and for her beloved sake
Mrs. Winans yearned over Ladybird with inexpressible
tenderness.</p>

<p>With her husband's full concurrence in her plans she
had come to Rosemont hoping to find pretty Ladybird and
adopt her as her own.</p>

<p>For the shadow of orphanage and sorrow had fallen
darkly over the little curly, brown head with its will-o'-the-wisp
fancies.</p>

<p>In June Bruce Conway had sailed from New York on
the Mamaroneck, and all the world knew now that some
awful mysterious fate had overtaken the steamer, for she
had never reached port nor been sighted during the
voyage; and after she had been fully a month overdue her
lifeboats had been seen drifting empty on the ocean. It
was certain then that the Mamaroneck had been wrecked,
but at first it was hoped that the passengers had been
rescued from the lifeboats by some other steamer. Alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
weary months had come and gone, and still no tidings of
the fifty souls, passengers and crew, of the Mamaroneck.
Hope died out in every heart. They were given up for
lost. The sea had claimed them for her victims.</p>

<p>To the Winans family the news of the probable death of
Bruce Conway came with a shock of pain, and their
sympathies turned to the orphaned girl left lonely in the
wide world.</p>

<p>Ladybird had kept up at first an occasional correspondence
with Precious, but at last it had closed abruptly,
and, as the traveling party were always on the wing, her
whereabouts were quite unknown to them. But they
hoped to find her with her aunt at the pretty cottage home
at Rosemont.</p>

<p>But cruel disappointment awaited their inquiries.</p>

<p>Ladybird had indeed returned home in September, but,
crushed by the news of her father's death, had drooped
and paled like a broken flower.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lawyer Stanley, who had been Mr. Conway's
legal adviser, had declared his belief in his client's death,
and produced papers by which he was chosen Ladybird's
guardian. He asserted that Mr. Conway had died bankrupt
through unfortunate speculations, and that his
daughter was penniless. But professing sincere friendship
for the dead, he accepted the charge of Ladybird as a
sacred trust. Miss Prudence Primrose had been sent to
California, to a half-brother there, and then Mr. Stanley
had moved away to New York with his family, consisting
of an invalid wife and Aura, to which was now added the
charge of a helpless orphan girl whom Aura hated so
bitterly that it seemed strange to think that the father
could feel so deep an interest in her welfare.</p>

<p>"We must find the little girl, and take her home with us.
She will be a pleasant companion for Precious when our
dear Ethel is married and gone," said the senator kindly,
and his wife added:</p>

<p>"Yes, we must find her, for I know she is not happy
with that coarse-grained Aura Stanley. She must come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
to us and be our daughter, for she has more claim on us
than on her father's lawyer."</p>

<p>Ethel and Precious both agreed that Ladybird was a
darling, and that it would make them very happy to have
her for a sister; but Earle Winans never bore any part in
these discussions, although he listened to them in silent
eagerness, wondering if it would ever happen, as they were
planning, that Ladybird should come to them as a sister.
He knew by the feverish throb of his passionate heart that
he loved her still, despite the pride and anger that strove
for mastery in his haughty breast.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I deemed that time, I deemed that pride<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had quenched at last my boyish flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor knew till seated by thy side<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My heart in all save hope the same."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One day when he was seated at a desk in the library,
with his dark, curly head bent dejectedly on his hand, a
light footstep crossed the floor, and a tender arm stole
around his neck. He looked up into his mother's tender
face, that was quite young and lovely still, in spite of her
forty years.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are sad. Why is it?" she asked
lovingly.</p>

<p>"It is only your fancy, dearest," he replied, summoning
a smile.</p>

<p>"Earle, I have something to ask you. Will you go to
New York on a little mission for me?" she asked softly,
threading his dark curls with her slender, jeweled fingers.</p>

<p>"You can command me, dearest mother, to go to the
ends of the earth for you," he replied smilingly, but with
real affection.</p>

<p>"Good boy! But I will not impose on you like that.
It is only to take a little run up to New York, find these
Stanleys and persuade Ladybird to come here to us with
you."</p>

<p>He made a vehement ejaculation, and she saw the
crimson mount to his temples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will do this for me, my son?" she cooed, in that
soft, caressing voice he had loved ever since it had soothed
him to his infant slumbers.</p>

<p>But he rose to his feet impatiently.</p>

<p>"You do not know what you ask&mdash;you do not understand&mdash;"
he began hotly.</p>

<p>The sweetest, most knowing little smile dawned on Mrs.
Winans' exquisitely curved red lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy, I know more than you suspect," she
smiled. "Do you think I did not know, last summer,
that you and Ladybird had been lovers? It was a silly
madcap prank, that little affair of hers, but she was so
young, so thoughtless, it can easily be forgiven. And she
loved you through it all, I am sure."</p>

<p>"She promised to marry another man," he said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Only fun. She did not mean it, poor little madcap,"
smiled his mother; then more seriously she added: "I am
sure the little girl loves you, Earle, and I want you to forgive
her and bring her back to us. Promise me."</p>

<p>"I cannot forgive," he murmured unsteadily, and she
looked at him in gentle wonder, and answered:</p>

<p>"Then, my son, your love was not worth much if it lacks
the quality of forgiveness that is inherent in all true affection.
And Ladybird, poor child, has been punished
enough for her willful prank. Remember she went away
without seeing you when you were wounded, although I
have seen her wistful eyes turned often toward your door
with a silent yearning that almost melted my heart. But
we let her go without a sign that we understood her proud
and silent grief. It was her punishment, and she bore it
without murmuring. But now the heavy hand of orphanage
and sorrow is upon her, and it is cruel to harbor resentment."</p>

<p>"Ah, mother, I wish I could be good, like you," he
breathed huskily.</p>

<p>With a gentle sigh she answered:</p>

<p>"The good that is in us, Earle, has to be perfected by
years of experience. As the ardor of our youthful passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
fades we become more reasonable and more ready to condone
the faults of others. I can see in your proud, impulsive
nature the traits of your parents reflected, so I
cannot blame you too severely for your unrelenting disposition
toward your willful sweetheart; but, dear Earle, I can
also assure you, out of the wisdom of suffering and experience,
that forgiveness is one of the noblest attributes of
human nature, and brings with it an exquisite peace and
happiness that is its own best reward."</p>

<p>The violet eyes were soft with unshed tears, and the low
voice was as sweet as music. Earle Winans' moody anger
dissolved like mists of dawn before her sweet influence.</p>

<p>He put his arms lovingly about her, and as he kissed the
calm, white brow he whispered:</p>

<p>"Angel-mother, you make me ashamed of my harshness.
I will not cherish my resentment any longer. It shall be
as you say. I will seek Ladybird and bring her home to
you."</p>

<p>"Heaven speed your mission," she cried between tears
and smiles, and before many hours he was on his way to
New York, with a lighter heart than he had borne for
months.</p>

<p>But four days later a brief note came to his mother:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have found the Stanleys, but Miss Conway is not with them.
She married Jack Tennant two weeks ago, and went to California on
her wedding tour.</p>

<p>Although Congress was not to convene until the usual
time in December, the Winans family went to Washington
in October's last bright days ere the golden autumn haze
was dimmed by the gray mists and fogs of November.</p>

<p>Among the series of fashionable entertainments with
which the gay world opened the social season the coming
out of Precious Winans marked a brilliant event.</p>

<p>Since her mother's first appearance in Washington
society years ago as the senator's bride no such wonderful
beauty had carried society by storm.</p>

<p>Society raved over the girl, to whose wondrous charms
was added the sensation of last March, when, after her
kidnaping at the Inauguration Ball, she had been so
romantically rescued by Lord Chester. Her admirers
were legion. She had a social triumph so splendid that it
might have turned any young girl's head.</p>

<p>But Precious did not enjoy it as she would have done
last winter, when all her artless heart had been set on long
dresses and social pleasures.</p>

<p>The beautiful girl was strangely changed from six
months ago.</p>

<p>Her pretty childishness had dropped from her like a
garment, and in its place was a new, sweet dignity almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
womanly. Much of her willfulness had left her, and instead
of opposing Ethel as she had done in the old days
Precious yielded passively to her sister's wishes, often
saying, with a pensive shade on her brow:</p>

<p>"We must let Ethel have her own way about everything,
because we are going to lose her so soon."</p>

<p>Ethel was radiant in those days. She did not envy her
sister's social triumphs, she rejoiced in her success, and
was always watching closely to see if any lover ever touched
the girl's heart.</p>

<p>And surely, she thought, there were so many to choose
from that Precious must yield her heart to one.</p>

<p>In the list of conquests were numbered a millionaire
senator, middle-aged but handsome; a member of the
French Legation, a German baron with his breast covered
with jeweled orders of honor, two Southern colonels, a
noted Northern general, and several score of "gilded"
youths. No girl in her senses could reject all these brilliant
opportunities.</p>

<p>But Precious had the same cheerful smile, the same
kindly word for all, and if twitted in the domestic circle
about her adorers she always cried out that she never intended
to marry any one. She loved papa and mamma so
well that she would never go away and leave them. Earle
and Ethel would marry, of course&mdash;but as for her, no
indeed, never!</p>

<p>And then she would nestle in her father's clasp, and
stroke his dark whiskers with her dimpled white hands,
and smile up at him with those dazzling dark-blue eyes in
fondest affection, while he would answer that he wanted
her to stay with him always, always, that it would break
his heart if she ever married and went away.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid, papa, for I will always love
you best," she laughed, but Ethel heard these promises
with secret pain. They made her feel sure that Precious
still loved Lord Chester with a hopeless passion that would
make her go unwedded to her grave.</p>

<p>So the days fled fast, and very soon Lord Chester would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
arrive to bear away his dark-eyed bride. They would not
await the conclusion of the lawsuit that still dragged
wearily through the English courts. Ethel was anxious to
prove the disinterestedness of her love. And in any case
she would not be poor. Her father had promised her a
magnificent dowry.</p>

<p>The trousseau had arrived from Paris, and was all that
a woman's heart could crave. Ethel thrilled with delight
over the beautiful creations, fancying how fair they would
make her appear in Arthur's eyes. Ah, surely, surely, she
would win back his truant heart that for a little while had
strayed from its allegiance. And Precious was so young,
so much admired, she would soon forget, and console herself
with another lover.</p>

<p>These thoughts ran through her mind as she stood alone
in her dressing-room, admiring the bridal veil as it lay
upon a table for inspection.</p>

<p>"She is so young she will soon forget," she repeated
again, and just then some one entered the room and stood
by her side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel, how do you do? Norah said I might
come right up and see you. She knew you wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>It was Hetty Wilkins, the deposed maid; but the girl
was a mere wreck of her former blooming self, her cheeks
all wan, her eyes heavy as if with unshed tears, her clothing
sloven.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hetty, what have you been doing to yourself?
You look ill, my poor girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel, I am ill&mdash;heart-sick, too. Oh, please
forgive me for coming, but you said if I ever needed help&mdash;and
so I came."</p>

<p>"And quite right, Hetty," cried Ethel, dragging out her
purse. She selected a ten-dollar gold piece, and held it
out, saying generously:</p>

<p>"I have more if that is not enough, Hetty."</p>

<p>Hetty looked at the gold piece, but she did not offer to
take it, and when Ethel doubled it with another piece she
shook her head and whimpered reproachfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too little; you must pay me more than that for
keeping your dangerous secret! You were with your sister,
miss, at the fortune-teller's when the fire broke out in
the house. How was it you escaped and left her there?
Why have you and she always kept the secret of your
presence there&mdash;tell me that?"</p>

<p>The Parthian shaft told on Ethel. She recoiled with
a gasp of terror from her accuser, and before she could
speak Hetty followed up the advantage by adding:</p>

<p>"I think you'll own that a secret like that is worth
more than a twenty-dollar gold piece, Miss Ethel, won't
you? And I'm poor, and so is my young man. We want
money to get married and start in life. A thousand dollars
ain't much to you, with such a rich pa, but it'll be a mint
of money to me."</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars!" gasped Ethel, then she whispered:</p>

<p>"Hetty, who has been telling you these falsehoods
about me?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't false, Miss Ethel, it's God's own truth, no
matter how I found it out. And unless you want me to
out with it all to your pa and ma you must fork over a
thousand dollars by to-morrow. I know you can do it.
Mr. Winans will give you the money for your wedding
fixings if you say the word. And I will come back to-morrow
afternoon and get it."</p>

<p>The girl paused and looked at Ethel with a pleading air
strangely at variance with her defiant tone, and in truth
there was something of abject shame in her eyes as she
waited cringingly for Ethel's answer.</p>

<p>"What if I refuse?" at length asked the young girl
proudly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel, please don't," and Hetty's voice was
almost a sob. "I&mdash;I&mdash;am almost ashamed of myself, but
look, how poor I am, and these shabby clothes, too; I've
not been in service since I left you, and I'm out of money,
and I've gone hungry many a time. Oh, please, please,
give me a thousand dollars," and Hetty suddenly fell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
her knees and plucked piteously at Ethel's gown, adding:
"It looks ungrateful in me I know, but I love you, and I
never would have come only they made me&mdash;No, no, I
don't mean that&mdash;my poor head is dazed. It was the
dreadful poverty made me come."</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars would relieve your poverty, Hetty,"
the young girl said, coldly and suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Miss Ethel, not a cent less than one thousand.
It's the price of your safety. Only give me that, and no
one shall bother you afterward. You needn't fear the secret
any more after that price is paid."</p>

<p>"But, Hetty, there's nothing to fear in that secret,"
cried Ethel, frantically explaining how the rope had
broken. "I was half crazed with grief at first, and after
my sister was saved we agreed between us that nothing
need be said. I was ashamed of having gone to the old
fortune-teller," she said, remembering with a keen pang
the old hag's prediction: "You will sin and you will
suffer."</p>

<p>But Hetty remained sullenly unconvinced, and answered
boldly:</p>

<p>"You were certainly afraid of something, Miss Ethel,
or you would not be keeping it so dark. And, anyway,
you wouldn't like to be exposed after all these months,
would you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," admitted Ethel miserably, and in the end
she agreed to pay the price demanded for the keeping of
her secret.</p>

<p>It seemed strange and embarrassing that when Lord
Chester arrived in the last week of November he should
find no one at home but Precious.</p>

<p>They knew that he had sailed for America, but his
steamer had made such rapid time that he arrived in
Washington before they knew that he had landed.</p>

<p>Ethel had gone with her mother on a little shopping
tour that morning, and Precious remained at home to rest
from the fatigue of a ball she had attended the previous
evening.</p>

<p>She had risen late and breakfasted in her own room.
Then she came down to the drawing-room in a simple
morning dress of soft pale blue with silver embroidery,
and cords of blue and silver holding in the full loose folds
at the waist. Her golden locks, half-loose, half-curled, fell
carelessly about her shoulders, framing the exquisite face,
with its deep-blue eyes and pink, dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>She was all alone but for Kay, who lay curled up lazily at
her feet on a splendid fur rug, now and then snapping
crossly at the tiger-head with open jaws that seemed
threatening his destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>She was not thinking of visitors that morning, and lay
back at ease in a great armchair with her arms over her
head in a pretty, careless pose, when suddenly, without
warning, the portieres at the door were swept aside by a
white hand, and a man entered the room. His step made
no sound on the thick carpet, but perhaps her instinct told
her the truth, for she turned her head, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Precious!"</p>

<p>"Lord Chester!"</p>

<p>It was their first meeting since that night by the river,
when she had torn herself from the fond arms that claimed
her for his own and sent him back to renew his troth
with her unhappy sister.</p>

<p>The memory of that moment rushed over both. They
grew pale with emotion, and their voices faltered.</p>

<p>Precious had started to her feet, and was looking at him
with dilated blue eyes. With an effort he returned to the
present.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I startled you entering so suddenly, but
James told me to come in and wait, that he thought all
the family were in."</p>

<p>"No, papa is at the capitol, and mamma and Ethel are
out shopping. I expect them in at any moment. You
will sit down and wait?"</p>

<p>She was not very cordial. She had not offered him her
hand, but he sat down in a chair close to her, and Kay
went over and fawned upon him in delight.</p>

<p>"My old friend is glad to see me again," he said, caressing
the mastiff's great head with tender hands, and she
smiled pensively and continued:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;that is we&mdash;were not expecting you so soon."</p>

<p>"The Paris made a quick trip&mdash;almost broke the record.
She was not really due until to-morrow. I came immediately
to Washington, hoping," reproachfully, "for a
warmer welcome."</p>

<p>Something in his voice and eyes went to her heart. She
colored painfully, and stammered:</p>

<p>"They will be here directly, and Ethel will be delighted
to find you here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;you, Precious&mdash;what a cold welcome you have
given me, not even a touch of your little hand."</p>

<p>He saw her young bosom heave with secret emotion.
The color came and went like the rosy dawn light on her
cheek.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;beg pardon. I did not think," she faltered, with
what seemed to him frosty courtesy. He burst forth
bitterly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps my altered prospects have changed your
esteem for me. Between the heir of an earldom and a
poor man there is a vast difference. It can even alter
friendship."</p>

<p>Precious looked at him in surprise and indignation, and
answered quickly:</p>

<p>"Not friendship, only its imitation. Nothing can
change true friendship, mamma says; but she has also
told me that nothing is so rare in the world as imperishable
friendship. But between true friends no change of
fortune can make any difference."</p>

<p>Her earnest blue eyes were raised to his with sudden
frankness as she confessed: "I did not offer you my hand
because&mdash;I was not sure you felt any friendship for me.
You&mdash;you parted from me in anger."</p>

<p>"I was mad with pain. Forgive me for my anger," he
answered sadly, and added: "Permit me to refer to the
past just once, and no more forever."</p>

<p>She bowed with drooping lashes, and he continued in a
voice that was freighted with deep emotion:</p>

<p>"At that time, Precious, I was mad for your love, and
friendship seemed so poor and tame beside it that I would
have counted it as of little worth. But how times
change!"</p>

<p>He drew a long, quivering breath, and continued:</p>

<p>"We have put the past behind us. You, they tell me,
are to be another man's wife. I am to be your sister's
husband. You will be my sister, and something within
me yearns for your friendship. Next to love it is the
sweetest, purest emotion of life. Like the edelweiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
growing on the high, pure altitudes of the Alps, the rare
white flower of friendship can only bloom in imperishable
beauty in the congenial soil of a noble nature. Will you
grant me this great boon, Precious&mdash;your life-long friendship?"</p>

<p>The eager, dark-gray eyes looked at her pleadingly, but
their light was almost holy as he prayed for this place in
her heart and life, to be remembered as a faithful friend
rather than a disappointed lover.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Something like these beautiful, holy thoughts beamed
in Lord Chester's eyes and thrilled in his voice as he spoke
to Precious, and melted her heart to responsiveness.
Deeply moved she held out her little hand to him, and he
clasped it warmly in his own.</p>

<p>At that moment the portieres of the door again parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
noiselessly, and Ethel stood like a picture framed between
them.</p>

<p>"Arthur!" Ethel almost shrieked, and the clasped hands
fell apart quickly, and the young pair sprang to their feet,
each one crying confusedly:</p>

<p>"Ethel!"</p>

<p>At the same moment they moved toward her and
Precious glided instantly from the room, believing the
meeting of the betrothed lovers too sacred to be intruded
on even by a sister.</p>

<p>Was there a silent, unacknowledged pain also at the
bottom of her young, noble heart?</p>

<p>If there was she would not have owned it even to her
own heart. She went to the library, took a new book
and tried to lose herself in its fascinating pages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Arthur, with a pang like death at his heart,
went forward and took Ethel's hand while he stooped and
kissed her crimson lips with a feigned warmth, inquiring
gently:</p>

<p>"Are you surprised?"</p>

<p>"Very much so," she replied with a sarcastic intonation.</p>

<p>"At my early arrival, I mean?" he went on with a
flush rising to his brow. Leading her gently to a seat he
continued:</p>

<p>"The Paris made a very fast trip and I am here before
you expected me. Are you glad, Ethel?"</p>

<p>He looked anxiously into her dark eyes. They were
flashing angrily and her slender foot tapped the carpet
vehemently. Not a word came from her crimson lips.</p>

<p>"Are you glad?" he repeated gently, but she bit her lips
without reply.</p>

<p>Lord Chester waited impatiently several minutes, but
Ethel preserved the same scornful mien.</p>

<p>Then he rose indignantly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am unwelcome. You have repented your
decision in my favor. I had better go," he said with
hauteur.</p>

<p>Then she lifted her dainty gloved hand with a gesture
for him to resume his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not go," she said icily, "until you have explained
the tableau I witnessed when I entered just now."</p>

<p>"The tableau!"</p>

<p>She answered curtly:</p>

<p>"You and Precious sat close together with clasped hands
like lovers. Am I to understand that my sister has deceitfully
stolen my place in your heart, and that it would be
best for me to resign my claim on your hand in her favor
also?"</p>

<p>They were daring words, and if she had not known that
Lord Chester was the soul of honor she would not have
risked them. There was many a man who would have
metaphorically "jumped at the chance" to be free of fetters
that chafed so cruelly.</p>

<p>But Lord Chester, standing before her with arms folded
on his broad chest, his dark-gray eyes ablaze with feeling,
answered low and reproachfully:</p>

<p>"It grieves me, Ethel, to have you display a causeless
jealousy for your noble and innocent young sister."</p>

<p>Ethel's red lips had curled at Arthur's tribute of praise
to her sister, and she cried out quickly:</p>

<p>"It is plain that you admire my sister very much."</p>

<p>"I do," he replied quietly. "Do you object, Ethel?"</p>

<p>She sighed bitterly as she answered:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, dearest Arthur; but I love you so dearly
that I would fain have you find no woman fair or admirable
but myself."</p>

<p>He kissed her hand loyally.</p>

<p>"My first thoughts must be for you always, my liege
lady," he replied, gallantly, then added: "But you must
permit me to admire always your lovely mother and sister.
Indeed, just before you entered I had begged Precious for
the promise of her friendship. She was so shy and cold
when I first came in she would not let me clasp her little
hand. But I teased her so much, ascribing her coldness
to my altered fortunes, that she was compelled to disclaim
such cruelty, and gave me her hand in token of unaltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
friendship. Will you believe that this was all, Ethel&mdash;that
in neither word nor deed were we disloyal to you?"</p>

<p>She could not doubt the truth in the dear, earnest eyes,
and in another moment she was sobbing against his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, I was wrong; but my jealous nature often
goads me almost to madness. Forgive me, and love me,
dearest, or my heart will break."</p>

<p>The anguished cry went to his heart, and he put his arm
about her and soothed her as well as he could, presently
winning her to calmness again.</p>

<p>But his own heart was very heavy.</p>

<p>Ethel's confession of her jealousy pained him and aroused
fears for the future, for he had an innate horror of a jealous
woman.</p>

<p>In two more weeks she would be his wife, and all his happiness
would rest in her keeping. Would she torture him
always by unreasonable jealousy?</p>

<p>The prospect was not pleasant, and he quailed in secret
before it, but it seemed to him there was no retreat from
this marriage, whose fetters would soon hold him in bondage.
It was a point of honor.</p>

<p>With a stifled sigh he gave himself up to the task of
entertaining his betrothed with an account of his summer,
and his trip across, and so well did he succeed that soon
the moody shadow faded from her brow and smiles dimpled
the crimson lips.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Mrs. Winans made the
discovery that Mr. Stanley had come in as an office-holder
under the new administration and that therefore he and his
family were living in Washington. So with a definite
purpose she called very soon on Miss Stanley, taking
with her Ethel and Precious. The latter she had instructed
to ask casually for Ladybird's address.</p>

<p>Precious was so eager over the matter that she soon
asked the question in a thoroughly natural manner, for she
loved Ladybird very dearly.</p>

<p>"Miss Stanley, I wish very much to have the address of
my old friend, Miss Conway."</p>

<p>Aura's red cheeks turned a deeper shade, and she said
hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"She is married now, you know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard so, and I wish very much to write
to her, as we were so fond of each other last summer,"
answered Precious, with such a loving light in her deep
blue eyes for her old friend that Aura hated Ladybird
more than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Tossing her dark head with a careless grace she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm very sorry, Miss Precious, that I can't
give you her address; but, really, I have not the faintest
idea where she is at present. She was such an ungrateful
girl that she has never written us a line since she married
Jack Tennant and went away."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry, for we all loved Ladybird dearly,
and I wished to invite her to my wedding," murmured
Ethel, suddenly taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your father knows her address," Mrs. Winans
said, looking suspiciously at the changing color of the
crafty girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, papa hasn't the slightest idea where&mdash;"
began Aura hastily, but just then she was interrupted.</p>

<p>The curtains at the door had been twitching nervously
several moments, and now they suddenly parted, and a
slender little figure rushed into the room. It was all in
black, and the pretty face was pale and sad, but they
knew it in a minute by the mass of dancing golden-brown
curls for Ladybird!</p>

<p>"Aura Stanley, you wicked girl, how dare you tell my
friends such falsehoods about me? You know very well I
am not married, and that I have lived under your father's
roof ever since the day I came from Europe!" she cried
angrily, her hazel eyes flashing like stars, and her pale
cheeks beginning to glow with resentment.</p>

<p>It was certainly a very trying moment for Aura, for now
she knew that her last chance of ingratiating herself with
the Winans family and winning Earle was over. They
would be sure to cut her acquaintance after this terrible
<i>exposé</i>.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to fly from the scene of her discomfiture,
but the next moment a clever thought came to
her, and she stood her ground boldly.</p>

<p>Coolly facing angry little Ladybird, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You need not call ugly names, nor look so angry,
Ladybird, for it is not my fault that you have been reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
married. Papa had his own reasons, I suppose, for
telling it, and for instructing me to say so. Of course
he did not expect that any one would come to inquire
after you, as your father left you a pauper on our hands."</p>

<p>No one was paying any attention to her words, for the
hapless orphan girl had been in turn kissed and caressed
by Mrs. Winans and her daughters while she was
speaking.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ladybird, you must come home with us, and
be my dear sister!" cried Precious tenderly.</p>

<p>"And my dear daughter," added her mother.</p>

<p>The burning tears rushed to Ladybird's eyes as she
cried gratefully:</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy I shall be to go with you, for I am
tired of being Mrs. Stanley's waiting-maid, with my
dependence thrown up to me every hour."</p>

<p>Aura's face crimsoned with anger as she retorted:</p>

<p>"You could not expect papa to support you like a fine
lady. You have no claim on him!"</p>

<p>The calm, refined Mrs. Winans turned to her and said
courteously:</p>

<p>"What you have said is quite true, Miss Stanley.
Ladybird has no claim on your father's care, but you will
no doubt be glad to hear that she has claims on others.
Her mother was my dearest friend, and as such I feel a
maternal interest in her orphan daughter. Ladybird
need not remain dependent on Mr. Stanley a moment
longer. She shall return with me to my home at once,
and take her place as my adopted daughter."</p>

<p>It seemed to Aura a wonder that she did not fall down
dead of pure anger and chagrin at those tender words from
the beautiful Mrs. Winans.</p>

<p>She gasped for breath and stood silent for a moment,
furious with rage so wild that she would have liked to
have struck pretty, triumphant Ladybird, nestling so
close to the gentle lady who had been her mother's dear
friend, and was now taking the daughter's part in this
noble fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>What could she say, what could she do to circumvent
their plans for her defeat?</p>

<p>She remained so quiet that Mrs. Winans added:</p>

<p>"We have already outstayed the limit of a first call, so
get ready at once, dear, and come home with us."</p>

<p>Then Aura found voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madam; but are you not overstepping
the bounds of your authority? Miss Conway is
my father's ward until she comes of age, and I do not
believe he will permit any high-handed measures such as
you propose in taking her from his guardianship. At
present I represent my father in forbidding Ladybird to
leave the house!"</p>

<p>She looked belligerent enough to defy them if necessary,
and after a moment's thought Mrs. Winans quietly conceded
her present authority. Kissing Ladybird tenderly she
bade her be of good cheer, as she would send her husband
at once to arrange matters with Mr. Stanley. Taking a
frigid leave of Aura she withdrew with her daughters.</p>

<p>Senator Winans was quickly apprised of the startling
denouement of the call on Miss Stanley.</p>

<p>"So our little Ladybird is not married at all! I always
half-doubted that story, but there is something very strange
in this prevarication and concealment," he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Then, dearest, you will go at once to see Mr. Stanley,
for I cannot rest until I have that poor, unhappy child
under my protection," cried his wife, the tears breaking
forth at memory of Ladybird's black dress and pathetic
face.</p>

<p>"I shall go at once," he replied, and when he had kissed
her and hurried away she sat down to write a letter to
Earle, who was lingering in the South with a party of
friends.</p>

<p>She knew intuitively that her boy's heart was very sore
over the supposed marriage of Ladybird, and would not
delay the glad tidings that his capricious little sweetheart
was still free. What joy it would carry to him, and perhaps
hasten his return!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the senator returned Mrs. Winans saw at
once that his efforts had been in vain.</p>

<p>"I have failed," he said sadly.</p>

<p>"Failed! Oh, Paul!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley refuses to give up Ladybird. By her
father's will, he is her guardian until she marries or reaches
the age of twenty. He has the law on his side, and we
seem powerless. But do not sob so bitterly, my darling,
for we will try to find some way to rescue our imprisoned
bird."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans hoped great things from her letter to
Earle.</p>

<p>She believed that his love for Ladybird would solve the
problem of all difficulties that hedged the young girl's
future.</p>

<p>Lawyer Stanley had told Senator Winans that his
authority over his ward would cease at her marriage, or
on her attaining the age of twenty. In the former clause
there appeared the one possibility of escape from the
clutches of her unkind guardian.</p>

<p>"If she and Earle could only make up their quarrel all
might end well," she thought, with all the complacency of
a match-making mamma.</p>

<p>Three days after her call on the Stanleys the post brought
her a letter from Ladybird that she welcomed with delight,
because she foresaw that it would make her plans easier
in every way.</p>

<p>Ladybird had written in a burst of tenderness and penitence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They will not let me come to you, nor write to you, my kind,
kind friend; but I have bribed a servant to mail this letter to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are too good and kind to me, dear Mrs. Winans, for you
surely cannot know how dreadfully I behaved to your son, or you
would not wish me to live under the same roof with him. You
would despise me as much as he does if you knew how silly I am,
and that I threw his love away just to show my power over a dozen
grinning idiots that I disliked in my heart. I was a wicked little
flirt, so happy and careless that I did not know how badly I was
behaving until Earle's scorn stung me into a realization of the truth.
Now I repent, but it is too late. I know he can never forgive me,
so how could I dare become an inmate of your home? I know that
the sight of me would be hateful to him, perhaps drive him from his
home.</p>

<p>"I have thought it all over and decided that it is best to stay
where I am, although these people are harsh and unloving. But,
after all the past, it would not be right for me to come to you.
Though I adore you all, I am rightly punished for my faults by being
forced to remain here. So leave me to my fate, and trouble yourself
no more over the misfortunes of unhappy</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ladybird</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it was treason to her impulsive young correspondent,
but when Earle arrived the next day Mamma
Winans lost no time in showing him the letter.</p>

<p>When she saw the glow of joy in his dark eyes she
knew that her boy's love was still faithful to his willful
little sweetheart, who had suffered so much for her girl's
romance.</p>

<p>"You will forgive her, Earle?" she cried anxiously, and
his smile answered her without word.</p>

<p>"Darling, I knew you would!" she cried joyously,
running her slender fingers through his crown of dark
curls and bending his head back against her arm to kiss
the noble white brow. Then they talked together over the
possibility of seeing Ladybird. They agreed that it must
be done by strategy. There would be no use to write to
her, for the jealous Aura would be sure to intercept the
letter.</p>

<p>Earle was boyishly happy and hopeful.</p>

<p>"So you would advise me to marry Ladybird, as her
only means of escape from her wicked guardian?" he
laughed. "Very well, little mamma, we will see what we
can do to deliver the princess from prison! Leave it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to me. I will take Lord Chester into my confidence, and
between us we will try to outwit the Stanleys in their
game of revenge!"</p>

<p>The week succeeding Lord Chester's return passed in a
whirl of receptions, cotillions, and opera parties, and at
each one he saw Precious the center of attraction, her
smiles eagerly competed for, her words listened to as
though each one was a jewel dropped from her lovely lips.
He did not wonder that they almost fought for the prize
of that fair little hand. It seemed to him, in the madness
of his hopeless, silent love, that he would have been willing
to lay down his life for the pleasure of calling her his
own even one short hour. In his heart was all the passion
of the poet's plaint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To know for an hour you were mine completely,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Mine in body and soul, my own&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I would bear unending tortures sweetly,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With not a murmur and not a moan!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If he had seen that Precious had a favored lover it
would have been the cruelest torture; but he was spared
that agony. She was the same to all&mdash;bright, sweet,
spirited, yet without a shadow of coquetry. To her
father's old friends, the gray-haired statesmen and
diplomats, she was as cordial and courteous as to the
young butterflies of fashion and wealth that hovered
around her; but in her sweet graciousness to all Lord
Chester saw no sign of that preference for one at which
Ethel had hinted in more than one letter. Bitterly,
jealously, he watched for his happy rival, and at last he
reminded Ethel of her letter, and asked the name of her
sister's lover.</p>

<p>The warm color flamed into Ethel's olive cheeks, and
she knit her dark, slender brows in momentary perplexity.</p>

<p>"Why, I have forgotten," she exclaimed, then added:
"Oh, yes, it was at Narragansett Pier, was it not, Arthur?
I remember it now, but I have forgotten the young man's
name, it is so long ago, and one meets so many strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in a summer! But the affair never came to anything
after all. Precious loved him, I know, but he was a
wretched flirt and went away without asking her to marry
him. You notice how sad she looks at times. I think
she still grieves in secret over her disappointment."</p>

<p>In his heart he doubted Ethel's story. There was no
man on earth who would have flung away the jewel of
Precious' love if he could have had it for his own. He
believed that Ethel, in her jealousy of her sweet sister,
had uttered an untruth.</p>

<p>And he quailed at the thought of spending all his life
with one who could stoop to so cruel a falsehood.</p>

<p>He was the soul of white-handed honor, this handsome
young scion of a noble house, and he held with the poet:</p>

<p>NOBLESSE OBLIGE.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I hold it the duty of one who is gifted,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And specially dowered in all men's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To know no rest till his life is lifted<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Fully up to his gift's great height.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He must mold the man into rare completeness,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For gems are set only in gold refined;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He must fashion his thoughts into perfect sweetness<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And cast out folly and pride from his mind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It gave Ethel a cruel pleasure to wound Lord Chester by
such stories of her sister. When she saw his handsome
face blanch and his proud eyes darken with pain, she felt
that she was taking a fair revenge for his heart's perfidy
to her who should have reigned in it supreme.</p>

<p>And at times like this the old, jealous pain and envy of
the innocent young sister who had come so fatally between
her and happiness ached in her heart almost to
frenzy, although she had learned cunning in its expression.
Many a time she shut her crimson lips tight over
the burning words of passion, but the close-kept fire only
smoldered more hotly in her heart, waiting for the slightest
breath to stir it into destructive flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>And suddenly the day and the hour came when, maddened
by jealous love, she was ready to palter with temptation
as terrible as that which had once before breathed its
poison breath upon her soul.</p>

<p>It was at a masquerade ball given by the wife of a cabinet
official that Ethel's hovering fate found her out.</p>

<p>A strange freak of fancy had made the beautiful brunette
choose the garb of a nun for the gay pageant of the night.</p>

<p>Precious had chosen quite a different costume, but she
had concealed from all but her mother and Ethel the
character she chose to personate. She had all the <i>debutante's</i>
curiosity to find if any one would detect her identity
behind her mask.</p>

<p>Within an hour after they reached the ball Ethel saw
Lord Chester in his character of King Arthur of Ye Table
Round in close converse with a masked princess whom
she knew as Precious. The pair were sitting a little apart
from the crowd in a secluded flowery alcove, and the
thought instantly rushed over Ethel that her sister had
played her false, and confided to her lover the secret of
her mask. "It is a cunning trick to enjoy each other's
society," she muttered angrily, and her heart leaped to
suffocation under the plain gray serge gown with its long,
straight folds, and the rosary hanging down by her side.</p>

<p>She was standing alone for a moment in the conservatory
door, and the low, muttered words reached the ears of a
knight just behind her who had hovered unobserved for
some time in her vicinity. At her angry heart-cry and the
heavy sigh that breathed over her lips, the knight's eyes
flashed beneath his mask, while his lips curled in a diabolical
smile. Moving close to her ear he whispered gallantly:</p>

<p>"Clouds often hide the stars, but the white cap of the
nun cannot obscure the brilliancy of Miss Winans, the star
of Lord Chester's heart."</p>

<p>Was there a sneer in the low voice? Ethel looked
around with a start, and there was the knight at her elbow,
with a form and voice that seemed entirely strange. Yet
he had recognized her instantly, so he must be one of her
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>But before she could speak he continued:</p>

<p>"Yet your choice of a costume surprises me. Miss
Winans is not one to wear a penitential mood or garb.
She is of the earth earthy, and must feel her heart thrill
with jealous rage beneath even the sacred garb of the nun."</p>

<p>"Who are you that can know Miss Winans so well?"
she asked, with blended anger and surprise, and his
low-breathed answer was startling:</p>

<p>"I am one on whose fiat hangs the future of Miss Winans
for good or ill!"</p>

<p>Ethel felt a strange thrill of repulsion run over her
frame, and cresting her head with a haughty movement
unbefitting her convent garb she exclaimed sternly:</p>

<p>"Your jest is ill-timed, sir!"</p>

<p>A low laugh answered her&mdash;low and menacing. Somehow
the blood ran coldly through her veins at the sound.
Shuddering, she was turning away when his hand fell
lightly on her arm, staying her steps.</p>

<p>"Let me speak to you a moment in the conservatory,
Miss Winans. I come to you from Hetty Wilkins," he
said coolly.</p>

<p>She dared not hesitate. Trembling with fear she followed
him to a quiet place, where there could not possibly
be any listeners. They sat down side by side, and he
whispered:</p>

<p>"When Hetty Wilkins came to you for a thousand
dollars, I sent her. I hold the secret of your presence in
the burning house, and the secret of your cruel abandonment
of your sister to a terrible fate."</p>

<p>"It is not true. It was an accident," she muttered
hoarsely; then with a searching glance: "Perhaps you
are Lindsey Warwick."</p>

<p>"No matter what my name is, I am one who will
betray your guilty secret unless you pay my price for
keeping it. You have paid Hetty, now you must pay me.
I do not believe you will shrink from the price of your
safety, for it is only that you will betray into my hands to-morrow
the beautiful sister that you hate!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans went with her husband to the capitol
next morning, leaving her two daughters preparing for a
trip to the dressmaker.</p>

<p>But when the iron-gray horses were champing their bits
impatiently in the street, and the coachman waiting on
the box, Ethel sent her new maid Laura to ask Precious
to come to her dressing-room.</p>

<p>She found her sister lying languidly on a silken divan,
scarcely able to speak, and the maid explained:</p>

<p>"Miss Winans had a fainting spell when she was dressing."</p>

<p>"I shall be better after awhile. It is only the over-fatigue
of last night. But I could not endure the ordeal
of Madame La Mode this morning. You will have to go
alone, Precious," murmured Ethel faintly, and she did
indeed look ill and weak. Perhaps the treachery she was
planning did not come easy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can postpone it till to-morrow," Precious
answered.</p>

<p>"No, for madame is so very busy, and would be seriously
put out if we do not go to her this morning. Besides, she
can finish that waist of yours to-day. If you are afraid to
go alone in the carriage, take Norah."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Norah is quite sick this morning, Ethel, but I am not
afraid of anything. I can go alone."</p>

<p>"That is right, for&mdash;oh, Precious, I want a little favor
from you!"</p>

<p>The maid had retired and closed the door. Ethel
beckoned her sister nearer.</p>

<p>"Have you any pin-money left?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; do you want some?" bringing out a little silk
net purse with gold coins gleaming through its violet
meshes.</p>

<p>"Not for myself, Precious, though I spent all mine the
day after papa gave it to me. But it was for charity, and
you know mamma likes us to be kind to the poor."</p>

<p>"I would like to help, too, Ethel. Tell me how to
spend this."</p>

<p>"You remember my old maid, Hetty Wilkins, that
mamma dismissed so suddenly at Rosemont? Well, her
lover deserted her, and she sank into ill-health, and is
dying of a broken heart. She is very poor, and lives with
an old grandmother that keeps a tobacco shop. She came
to see me once since we returned here, and I gave her some
money. In fact, I have been to see her twice, and all my
pin-money goes on poor Hetty, for I do not like to see her
suffer for the necessaries of life after the way she was turned
out of her place on an unjust suspicion," and Ethel sighed
deeply over poor Hetty's fate.</p>

<p>"And you want me to give the poor girl some money?
Oh, I will do it gladly. Tell me her address, and I will
send it to her this morning," cried Precious, her sweet
blue eyes glowing with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Would you mind taking it to her yourself, Precious?
Yesterday she sent me a little note begging me to come to
her this morning&mdash;that she was so ill she could not live
much longer. I promised to go, and would have gone only
for this strange fainting spell. But if you would take my
place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, I will! Poor, poor Hetty! I think
mamma would be very sorry to know she had wronged her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Oh, Ethel, wouldn't it please Hetty for mamma to go with
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! not for the world! The poor girl would
not like it at all. And mamma is peculiar about some
things. She would be angry if she knew I had befriended
my poor maid; so, if you do this favor for me, it must be
in secret."</p>

<p>"But, Ethel, is it right to deceive our dear mamma?"</p>

<p>"Have you never kept any secret from mamma?" demanded
Ethel, with her keen eyes searching the lovely
young face.</p>

<p>Precious grew pale, then crimson, for though she had
always made a confidante of her mother she knew that one
page was folded down in her heart on which was written
the story of a beautiful, hopeless love that no one must
ever read.</p>

<p>"Ah, your blush betrays you!" cried Ethel exultantly,
and after a moment Precious answered:</p>

<p>"There is one secret, Ethel, that you bade me keep,
you know!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Ethel fearfully, and grew pale as death.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to mention it, Ethel; but now tell me
what you wish me to do. You are older than I, and you
would not surely bid me do anything wrong!"</p>

<p>"No, dear, only a little deed of charity; only to slip
out from madame's and go on foot to this address, see
Hetty a few minutes, give her some money, and explain
why I failed to come, then return on foot as you went, for
it would not do to take the carriage into such a shabby
place. The coachman would talk about it, then mamma
would find out. After I'm married and gone you can
confess it all to her if it lies uneasy on your conscience,
little saint," added Ethel, pressing a little note from Hetty
into her sister's tiny gloved hand.</p>

<p>"I'll manage it," Precious promised, and stooping,
pressed a light and tender kiss on Ethel's Judas lips.
"Poor dear, you do look very sick. I'll send Laura back
to sit by you while I'm gone. By-by," and Precious glided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
out, the soft <i>frou-frou</i> of her silk carriage gown sounding
in Ethel's ears like a thunder-peal of reproach.</p>

<p>She half-lifted herself on the divan, her face ghastly,
her white jeweled hand pressed hard against her heart,
that was beating to suffocation.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, what have I done? But it was the price
of my safety, the price of my happiness!" she moaned
faintly, and when the maid came in presently she found
Ethel weeping like one distraught.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it, dear Miss Winans? Are you worse?"
exclaimed the maid anxiously.</p>

<p>"N-n-no, but I'm so sorry I could not go with Precious
this morning. Give me a sedative, Laura, for I'm so
nervous I shall be in hysterics presently."</p>

<p>"Must I send for the doctor, miss?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! I'll be better presently if I take that
medicine. There, that will do. Leave me alone now, and
I'll try to sleep."</p>

<p>She shut her eyes and tried to lie still, but now and then
she brushed her hand across her pale lips.</p>

<p>"She kissed me good-by, and it burns my lips, it is like
fire!" she muttered, almost deliriously. "Ah, Precious,
Little Blue Eyes, will it always burn like this, or will
Arthur's cold kiss cool the fire of remorse? Will I ever
forget last night and to-day?"</p>

<p>She lay still as death a little while, her face death-white,
her eyes closed, but all alive within with wild emotion.
She felt like a murderess.</p>

<p>The sedative took no effect. She could not sleep. Time
passed on and she lay with her brain on fire till the low
chime of a French clock striking noon startled her like a
clarion tone.</p>

<p>Ethel sprang wildly from the couch and sought her
writing-desk. With a shaking hand she wrote a few lines,
enveloped and sealed the note, then wrote on the back her
sister's name.</p>

<p>Laura entered in answer to the tinkle of the little bell.</p>

<p>"You are better, Miss Winans?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and I want the carriage to come back for me.
Go, my good girl, as fast as you can to Madame La Mode's
with this note for my sister. Give it into her own hands,
and the faster you do my errand, Laura, the richer shall be
your reward."</p>

<p>"I'll run every step of the way, miss," promised the
girl, taking the letter, and darting out.</p>

<p>Ethel had written only this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Precious</span>:&mdash;Do not by any means go to Hetty. I have just
received a message that she is dead. You can do her no good now.
Come back immediately in carriage with Laura. I want you at
once.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ethel.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When the messenger had gone Ethel fell on her knees
beside a chair sobbing wildly:</p>

<p>"Would my mother's God listen if I tried to pray?
Dare one so wicked as I am pray that her own cruel plans
may miscarry, and that not one hair of that little golden
head be harmed by the fiend who tempted me to evil?"</p>

<p>Her bosom rose and fell with choking sobs, the tears
poured down her white cheeks, her slender hands clasped
each other in convulsive writhings.</p>

<p>"Dear God, have pity on me, a sinner!" she moaned.
"Save Precious, save me, from the consequences of my
guilty act! Oh! I repent, I repent! have mercy, Heaven!"</p>

<p>Her whole soul was shaken with remorse and grief at
thought of the fate to which she had doomed her innocent,
loving sister.</p>

<p>"Betrayed into the hands of a fiend who will murder
her unless she becomes his unwilling bride! What a horrible
fate for that gentle heart that sacrificed its dearest hopes
for me!" she thought, and bowed her face on her shaking
hands.</p>

<p>And ever on her lips burned like fire that parting kiss,
and in her ears rang the loving farewell words. Their
memory would not down.</p>

<p>"If she had not kissed me, if only she had not kissed
me, I should not have repented; I would have saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
myself at her expense; but now, now, let the blow fall on
me, and I&mdash;and I can die, for there is nothing left in this
world but misery and disgrace for poor Ethel!" was her
bitter cry.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and Laura flew in with the
unopened letter.</p>

<p>"Miss Precious was not there!" she panted. "Madame
said she had gone out to match some ribbons, but the
carriage was there waiting, and I told John to watch for
her and bring her back as soon as she returned. Oh, Miss
Ethel, dear, you're ill again!" for with a shriek that rang
to heaven Ethel flung out her arms and sank senseless on
the floor.</p>

<p>Precious hastened to the nearest milliner's from
Madame La Mode's, and having matched the ribbons
desired, sent them by messenger to the modiste. Her
plausible errand thus dispatched, she covered her lovely
face and hair with a thick black lace veil, and hastened
to the address Ethel had given her, eager to dispatch her
mission of kindness, and to get away as soon as possible
from the poverty-stricken and unfamiliar neighborhood.
She was as dainty as a princess, our pretty Precious, and
could not help finding poverty repulsive.</p>

<p>So her aristocratic little nose was quite high in the air
as she stepped across the threshold of the vile-smelling
tobacco shop, and approaching a parchment-faced,
bewigged old woman, much bent with age, queried
timorously:</p>

<p>"Does Hetty Wilkins live here?"</p>

<p>The old shopwoman eyed her closely through immense
goggle glasses, then answered gruffly:</p>

<p>"Certainly she lives here; but you beant the young gal
she wore expectin'. She had black eyes and hair."</p>

<p>"I am her sister. She sent me, because she was sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and could not come herself. May I see Hetty at once,
please?" asked Precious in a depressed voice, for the
squalor of the place lowered her girlish spirits unconsciously.</p>

<p>"In course you may see her; but she's very bad to-day,
and I don't think she'll live long," was the curt reply, as
the woman closed the shop door, placed a bar across it, and
then turned to explain:</p>

<p>"I have to shut the door when I go upstairs to Hetty,
because the bad boys will come in and steal everything."</p>

<p>She led the way through a back room up a dark, narrow
stairway with a door at the foot of it, to a small, close-smelling
bedroom as squalid as the rest of the place.
There, on a hard bed, among soiled pillows, lay the once
pretty, coquettish Hetty, who had been so anxious to marry
above her station.</p>

<p>Poor Hetty! there was no mistake in her claim that she
was dying of a broken heart, for anguish was stamped on
the wan, haggard features and gleamed out of the sunken
eyes beneath the tangled locks of hair that strayed
neglected over her ashen brow.</p>

<p>"There's Hetty, lady, and I hope you'll stay a long
time and talk to her, she's so lonesome a-layin' here all
day by herself," croaked the grandmother, pushing a
chair to the bedside. Then she lumbered heavily downstairs
again, coolly locking the door at the foot.</p>

<p>Then she closed up the shop for the day, after putting
a sign in the window to that effect. The next move was
to ascend to another room, where her worthy son was
shaving off his beard and arraying his very good figure in
purple and fine linen, hoping to propitiate his expected
guest.</p>

<p>"She's here!" she chuckled significantly, and he gave a
cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Good! She shall not escape me again."</p>

<p>"She's in Hetty's room. You better hurry! That girl
will tell tales."</p>

<p>"No matter what she tells, it cannot alter my lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
fate. My bride or the bride of death, she shall be ere tomorrow's
dawn! I am desperate with suspense and
thwarted love. Life without that girl can no longer be
borne. We must live together or die together, as she wills
to-day!"</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed with something almost like madness,
but the woman did not try to dissuade him from the terrible
purpose he had expressed. She knew from the experience
of long months how futile she would find such
an effort.</p>

<p>When beautiful Precious, in her rustling silks and laces,
bent over the sick girl with compassionate eyes, Hetty
started in surprise and horror, muttering feebly:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Miss Precious, or am I dreaming? This
morphine they give me makes me have strange dreams
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Poor Hetty!" and the soft little hand brushed the
straggling locks from the fevered brow. "Yes, it is
Precious. My sister was ill, and could not come to see
you, as she promised, so she sent me to bring you some
money for wine and dainties," and Precious poured
the little shower of golden coin out upon the thin counterpane.</p>

<p>Hetty's big hollow eyes dilated wildly, and she gasped:</p>

<p>"There's some mistake. Miss Ethel didn't promise to
come here. I haven't seen or heard of her since the time
I went to her and she gave me money. Oh, Miss Precious,
everything ain't right about this! You've been fooled
into coming here, you sweet lamb, and Lindsey Warwick
must be at the bottom of it. Oh, the fiend! How dare he
do it? You're in deadly peril, poor child, and you must
go away at once, if you can. There! run down the steps,
get away from this vile place as fast as you can!"</p>

<p>Precious flew to do her bidding, but she found the door
locked against her.</p>

<p>Ghastly pale and trembling, she sank into the chair
beside Hetty.</p>

<p>"You are right. I'm trapped, for the door is already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
locked!" she gasped; then exclaimed: "Oh, Hetty, Hetty,
is it true? Is Lindsey Warwick here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor child, it is true. Oh, Lord, spare me
breath to tell her all the truth! Oh, Miss Precious, you
know how foolish I was about my beau that was courting
me when your mother sent me off? She was right. He
was Lindsey Warwick, but I believed in him. I thought
he was Watson Hunter, as he said he was. When I came
to Washington I found him out. He was living here, and
I taxed him with being the drawing-master, but he denied
it. He swore he loved me, and brought a preacher here
and married me. At least I thought he was a preacher,
Miss Precious, and believed myself an honest wife. Oh,
my Lord! my Lord! how my life has been ruined by that
devil!" groaning. "Oh, my dearie, my innocent dove,
he led me a dog's life, but I stuck to him all the while
with devotion, doing everything he bade me, even to blackmailing
poor Miss Ethel and stripping her of money for
his sake! At last, when I refused to go back again, he
beat me cruelly and told me I wasn't his wife. It was a
sham, that marriage. He only courted me to find out
things about you to get you into his power again, and he
would have you soon, for he'd make your sister help him.
Then I fell down, dead, I hoped, but after awhile I came
to, lying on this bed, ill, and too weak ever to rise from it
again, dying by inches of neglect, privation, and despair.
And now, my poor, innocent little one, he has got you
in his power, and whatever is to become of you I cannot
tell."</p>

<p>The door opened softly and a mocking voice replied:</p>

<p>"I can tell you the end, Hetty. We will get married
and live happy ever after."</p>

<p>"Lindsey Warwick!" shrieked Precious wildly.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Lindsey Warwick only smiled at the frantic cry of
Precious, and sitting down coolly in a seat quite close to
her he said insolently:</p>

<p>"So we meet again, my beautiful, obdurate love."</p>

<p>Her beautiful blue eyes flashed on him with such supreme
scorn that the craven might have quailed before them, but
neither her anger nor the hollow, accusing eyes of poor
Hetty moved him in the least. He maintained a front of
the most insolent composure.</p>

<p>"I demand that you release me at once or you will suffer
dearly for this outrage!" Precious exclaimed in a choking
voice.</p>

<p>He smiled, and his insolent eyes seemed to gloat on her
pearl-fair beauty.</p>

<p>"You amuse me, but you do not frighten me at all,"
he replied, laughing.</p>

<p>"And yet you have need to be frightened," Precious
answered in a solemn voice, growing very pale as she
spoke.</p>

<p>He did not notice the peculiar significance of her voice,
but throwing himself back in his chair with an expression
of arrogance observed:</p>

<p>"I am sorry you object so much to have me for your
husband, for I have sworn to make you my wife or to kill
you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful girl sitting close to poor, gasping Hetty,
answered him with a look of silent scorn.</p>

<p>"It is true," he continued, "I love you madly, and I
have sworn to win you. I know the distance seems great
to you between the poor drawing-master and the petted
daughter of Senator Winans, but love has often bridged
gulfs as deep. Once we are married your parents will forgive
you, and your father can easily give me a lucrative
Government position that will place me on a high social
footing. You see how easy it all is, as I told your sister at
the masquerade ball last night."</p>

<p>A startled cry came from her pale lips, and he laughed:</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there, and often near you, for, like your
sister, I was jealous of the attentions of handsome King
Arthur, who hovered so often near the princess. Do you
remember the knight who tried to make love to you, and
on whom you turned a cold shoulder? Your sister was
not so unkind to me. We had a long talk in the conservatory,
and she helped me plan this little scheme that placed
you in my power."</p>

<p>Oh, the cry of agony that came from those lovely lips at
his words! They pierced poor Hetty's heart with their
doubt and pain!</p>

<p>"You speak falsely! My sister Ethel would not be so
cruel!"</p>

<p>"Your sister Ethel had no choice. I held the secret of
her desertion of you in the burning house that day&mdash;the
secret you kept at her bidding! She dare not let it be
known, for she knew that she was guilty of desiring your
death, because she was jealous of you."</p>

<p>Hetty moaned feebly:</p>

<p>"Don't you believe him, Miss Precious. Miss Ethel
would not be so wicked. It was the old woman, his
mother, that set fire to the house and ran away, hoping
you would both be burned up."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" Lindsey Warwick said, glaring
fiercely at the invalid. "What my mother did does not
excuse the sin of Ethel Winans. She escaped from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
fire and ran away, giving no alarm to let any one know
that Precious was left to an awful fate. She is afraid to
let the world know it, and when I threatened to betray her
she paid the price of my silence by sacrificing her sister."</p>

<p>Everything rushed over Precious. She could not doubt
that her proud, jealous sister hated her with an envious
rage. It was like a sword in her tender heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! I would sooner have died than heard
this hideous truth!" she moaned, and the fair golden head
sank until it rested on Hetty's coarse pillow, while the
white lids drooped heavily over the violet eyes.</p>

<p>Lindsey Warwick sprang eagerly forward, but Hetty
motioned him sternly back.</p>

<p>"You sha'n't touch her, you fiend, unless by her own
consent, and I know you'll never get that! So go out and
leave her to herself."</p>

<p>He laughed arrogantly in his consciousness of power and
answered:</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll leave her alone a few moments to get
used to her position; but no plotting for her escape, remember,
for there are bolts and bars on every door and window;
and none of the neighbors could hear her scream, if she tried
it all day. You know that by your own experience. So
you had just as well do me a good turn by persuading her
to marry me without more trouble. You didn't find it
hard to love me, so why should she?"</p>

<p>The look of scornful reproach she gave him might have
shamed a fiend, but he only laughed and went out, shutting
the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Miss Precious, look up, darling&mdash;he's gone now; look
up, and don't grieve. Maybe something will happen,
maybe Miss Ethel will repent and send your father to take
you from Lindsey Warwick. Oh, I wish I had a good
revolver; I'd shoot him like a dog, and let you go free!
My life's going out fast, anyway, and I'd not mind paying
off my score against him!"</p>

<p>Precious lifted up a pale, haggard face, murmuring:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Hetty; you must not die with the sin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
murder on your soul. Listen, while I whisper in your ear:
I have a splendid little revolver in my pocket. Papa gave
it to me after&mdash;that night last summer, you know. He
taught me to use it, and told me to always carry it when I
went out alone, and to defend myself with it, if necessary.
So don't worry over me, Hetty; I will kill him if there is
no other way of escape!"</p>

<p>But she shuddered, and grew so pale that Hetty muttered:</p>

<p>"Let me have it, dearie, and I'll do the deed for you
quick enough!"</p>

<p>"No," Precious answered; and just then the door
opened and the old woman came in, leering hideously at
the hapless prisoner.</p>

<p>Precious rose from her chair, and catching the old
woman's arm, suddenly asked imploringly:</p>

<p>"Won't you be good enough to open those doors, and
let me go home to my mother?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't do it for nothing. My son's orders is to
keep his pretty bird close!" was the chuckling reply.</p>

<p>Hetty half-raised herself in bed, and gazed curiously at
the pair. Something in the white, resolute face of
Precious prepared her for a startling denouement.</p>

<p>She saw the girl's hand slide into the folds of her dress
and out again. The next moment Hetty's eyes were dazed
by the gleam of a small silver-mounted revolver, whose
muzzle pressed the old woman's temple.</p>

<p>"Open the doors and let me go free, or I will kill you!
Not a word, or I fire!" breathed the desperate girl, low
and distinctly.</p>

<p>The old woman was a coward at heart. She almost
fainted from fear, and, forgetting her son's interests in her
own deadly fears, put her shaking hand in her pocket and
withdrew the key without one word, as she was bidden.</p>

<p>Precious and the eager, watching Hetty began to think
that victory would be easy.</p>

<p>"Now open the doors, and I will follow you until I
reach the street. Do not speak, or I shall certainly shoot
you," continued Precious sternly, still covering the bent,
cowering form with the lifted weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, the foiled hag pushed the
key in the lock, turned it sharply and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Go on down the steps while I follow," commanded
Precious hoarsely, and still keeping her weapon close to
the bewigged head, while she wondered at her own
desperate bravery and silently prayed Heaven to keep
Lindsey Warwick away until she gained her freedom.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. The villain rushed upon his own
fate.</p>

<p>Just as his mother placed her foot on the first step to
descend, he entered by an opposite door.</p>

<p>That suggestive tableau, his mother on the step,
Precious in the open doorway above, covering her descent
with a revolver, flashed upon his sight. He instantly
comprehended the truth. His prisoner, with an undreamed
of bravery, was fighting her way to freedom, and the
cowed old woman was permitting herself to be driven to
submission.</p>

<p>With the howl of a baffled wild beast, the startled villain
rushed forward and struck back the little hand that held
the weapon, perhaps with some faint impulse of filial
alarm for the old mother who seemed in such deadly peril.</p>

<p>But his aim was misdirected or rash. The weapon
dropped indeed from the little hand that grasped it, but
as he bent forward it fell upon the step and exploded, and
the bullet, whistling as it ascended, struck him beneath
the chin, crashing upward to his burning brain. He
sprang convulsively erect, then toppled backward in a
lifeless heap, dead as suddenly as though by a lightning
stroke.</p>

<p>At the same instant the old woman, jarred from her
position on the steps by his sudden onslaught, lost her
balance and fell, rolling over and over the steep narrow
stairs until her body bounded against the locked door at
the foot with a terrible velocity that broke her neck.</p>

<p>Thus two wicked wretches were hurled at a breath into
the presence of an offended God, to be judged and condemned
for the deeds done while they dwelt on earth.</p>

</div></div>


<p>A desperate courage upheld Precious through that
tragic scene, but at its fatal denouement she rushed back
to Hetty, falling on her knees by the bed, and bursting
into convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>And for a moment no other sound filled the room, for
the sick girl, struck dumb by the suddenness of it all,
could not utter a word, only lie still among her pillows
breathing in great strangling gasps, like one dying. For
those other two, they lay still and voiceless, stricken down
in the fullness of their evil career, just as victory in their
evil designs seemed assured. But she, the innocent victim
of their persecution, sobbed on, distressfully, in the revulsion
of feeling from fear and desperation, to relief mixed
with shuddering horror at the fate of her enemies.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hetty began to recover her dazed senses, and
moving a trembling hand touched Precious gently.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, don't sob so hard. Try to collect
yourself and listen to me," she breathed faintly, and the
nervous girl lifted her head, murmuring:</p>

<p>"Oh, Hetty, Hetty, can't we get out of this horrid
place? I'm stifling, dying almost of fear and horror."</p>

<p>"Yes, we will get away as soon as possible," and Hetty
with sudden strength crawled out of bed and dragged on
her clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my dear young lady, I have a plan for you," she
panted. "You must not be known at all in this dreadful
affair, for it would make a dreadful sensation very unpleasant
to your folks. Here is my plan: There is a side
entrance on an alleyway to this place, and I'll creep down
and let you out of it. Then you must go away quietly
back to your home, and say nothing, unless you choose to
confide in your parents. I'll stay indoors awhile, then
I'll creep out in the street and give the alarm that my
husband and his mother have killed themselves scuffling
over a handsome revolver. No one need ever know anything
more, for they cannot doubt my story. The
neighbors all believe that I was Warwick's wife, as I should
have been. So go now, dear, and Heaven bless you, poor
child."</p>

<p>Her poor face was already beaded with death-dew, and
she staggered so that she had to cling to Precious as they
made their way down to the alley, just inside the door that
she was to go out by. Precious paused and looked anxiously
into the ghastly face with its glassy eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hetty, you do look so ill! I can't bear to leave
you like this. I shall tell mamma, and we will have you
cared for kindly."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, dear Miss Precious, but don't
worry over me. I'll soon be all right. Now go, for every
moment you stay is perilous."</p>

<p>"Bless you, Hetty, for your goodness to me. I shall
tell mamma about it. She will be so grateful, and we will
do everything for you. Now good-by, and God keep you
till we meet again."</p>

<p>She pressed the cold, damp hand fervently, and hurried
away, little dreaming that it was a dying woman she left,
and that her fervent "God keep you till we meet again,"
meant for all eternity.</p>

<p>With the thick veil over her face, she darted unobserved
out of the noisome alley, gained the street, and turned the
very first corner into a side street. Ten minutes of rapid
walking brought her back to Madame La Mode's, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the carriage still waited, although she had been gone almost
two hours. The obsequious footman helped her in, and
she sank half-fainting among the cushions.</p>

<p>"Saved! Saved!" she thought, with silent gratitude to
Heaven as the carriage rolled homeward, and she wondered
bitterly what Ethel would say on her return and escape
from the fate at which she had connived.</p>

<p>"Ah! my sister, to whose happiness I sacrificed my own,
how could you be so cruel?" she wept convulsively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dying Hetty, too weak to walk, crawled
through the narrow alleyway out to the street, a most
pitiable object with her wasted form, ghastly face, and
glassy eyes already dim with approaching death. Very
soon a crowd collected about her, to whom she told an incoherent
story that her husband and his mother, while
struggling over a revolver, had both come to their deaths.
Then having exhausted her feeble strength in explaining
the tragedy, the poor creature's head drooped heavily, and
with one or two convulsive gasps her spirit fled from its
earthly tenement.</p>

<p>The evening papers, in glaring head-lines, told the story
of the tragedy enacted in the humble tobacco shop, and
did not fail to add that the man had been discovered to be
the notorious Lindsey Warwick, who had abducted
Senator Winans' youngest daughter from the Inauguration
Ball, and for whose apprehension the statesman had
offered ten thousand dollars. It was added that he had
afterward married a girl in his own rank, and had beaten
her so cruelly that she had never been able to leave her
bed since, and had now died of her injuries.</p>

<p>Some relatives of poor unfortunate Hetty came forward,
claimed her body, and buried her decently. Lindsey
Warwick and his mother were interred at public expense,
and when those three died there was but one living soul
that held the secret that lay so darkly on Ethel's conscience&mdash;the
secret that twice she had betrayed her innocent
sister to a terrible fate from which the mercy of Heaven
had delivered her safely. At last Precious knew all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sister's guilt. Would she take revenge for her wrongs by
denouncing Ethel?</p>

<p>She reached home with a prayer of thanksgiving on her
lips, so glad of its peace and security again after the perils
of the last few hours; but as soon as she crossed the
threshold she saw that there was an unwonted commotion
and excitement about the house.</p>

<p>"Have they missed me already? Have they found out
anything?" she thought in alarm; but directly she heard
the servants confiding to each other that Miss Winans had
been taken dangerously ill, and that the wedding now so
very near at hand would have to be postponed, they
feared.</p>

<p>Then Norah came to meet her pet.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, how ill and pale you look! What has
happened to you?" she demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Norah, they are saying that Ethel is very ill!"
faltered Precious, and when she reached her own room she
sank tremblingly upon a sofa.</p>

<p>"Miss Ethel has an attack of hysteria," explained
Norah. "She had a long swoon, and when she revived
went into wild hysterics. The doctor and your mother
are with her now, and when I came out awhile ago she
was shrieking for you as though she thought you were in
the greatest danger somewhere. I think if you will go in
and see her that the sight of you will do her good."</p>

<p>"I will go at once!" cried Precious eagerly, and glided
pale as death into the sick-room, her heart beating with
great strangling throbs of emotion.</p>

<p>She crossed the floor to the bed, and saw Ethel writhing
among the pillows like one distraught, her dark eyes
glaring wildly on the anxious faces around her, while from
her ashen lips came over and over one yearning cry:</p>

<p>"Precious! Oh, bring Precious home!"</p>

<p>When Precious heard that entreating cry she felt that
Ethel had repented of her sin, that she was not as wicked
as she had tried to be. The knowledge brought keenest
joy to her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Ethel, dear sister, I am here!" she cried in a voice
of heavenly forgiveness.</p>

<p>Until that moment Ethel had seemed not to recognize
any one, had called no one but her sister, but as that sweet
voice came to her ears she looked up with a wild cry and clasped
Precious in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, you are safe! You have come back
to me!" she cried, and fainted for the third time that
morning.</p>

<p>"She has had some strange hallucination about her sister,
but she will be better now," said the physician, and he
was right, for when she recovered she was calmer, the light
of reason shone in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I am better now. You may all go away but Precious.
I want her to stay by me a little while," she murmured
faintly.</p>

<p>They all withdrew but Precious, to whom she clung with
eager hands.</p>

<p>When they were alone they looked eagerly into each
other's eyes, and Ethel saw that Precious knew all. A
deep and heavy sigh breathed over her lips, and she
murmured:</p>

<p>"You have escaped your enemies, thank Heaven!
Nothing else matters now, but tell me how it all happened."</p>

<p>And the trembling Precious, in low, agitated whispers,
told her all that had transpired except Hetty's death, of
which she did not yet know.</p>

<p>Ethel listened in silent joy. She rejoiced in the death
of her enemies, and she realized that her guilty secret
belonged to no one now but Precious. In those small,
white hands rested her fate.</p>

<p>Her dark, anguished eyes searched the pale, lovely face
with eager inquiry, and she faltered:</p>

<p>"You know all my sins against you now, Precious&mdash;all
my envious hate and jealousy. Are you glad that revenge
lies in your hands?"</p>

<p>"Revenge!" exclaimed Precious, and Ethel answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will betray me now to Arthur, to papa and
mamma, to the whole world!"</p>

<p>Precious looked searchingly into the dark eyes, circled
with heavy purplish rings since morning.</p>

<p>"My sister, do you repent?" she asked solemnly.</p>

<p>"Repent! Ah, Heaven, I should have died or gone mad
if harm had come to that little golden head!" breathed
Ethel huskily.</p>

<p>"And you will never hate me any more?" sighed
Precious.</p>

<p>"Never! never!"</p>

<p>"Then let us speak no more of that wicked thing&mdash;revenge.
Try to be good after this, dear sister; try to be
worthy of Arthur, and I will forgive you everything,"
noble little Precious answered, sealing the promise of
forgiveness with a gentle kiss.</p>

<p>"You are an angel!" sighed Ethel from her overburdened
heart, and drew from under her pillow the sealed
letter she had sent to Madame La Mode's by the maid.</p>

<p>"Read this and you will see how soon I repented of my
sin!" she said eagerly, and when Precious had read it
through her blue eyes filled with tears and she cried:</p>

<p>"I am glad you repented so soon, and if I had not left
the modiste's in such a hurry to perform a charitable deed
I would have received your message in time to have been
prevented from going."</p>

<p>They talked earnestly together some time longer, and it
was decided to keep to themselves the story of that morning's
adventure. Poor Ethel, she still clung to Arthur
and the hope of becoming his wife, and in the safety
insured by Lindsey Warwick's death and her sister's forgiveness,
she thought that no further obstacle could come
between her and happiness. Although sincerely repentant
for her cruelty to Precious, the leaven of selfishness still
worked in her nature, and she could not resign the joy
within her reach&mdash;the joy of becoming Arthur's wife, and
trying to win back his heart.</p>

<p>Earle Winans, acting on his mother's hints, had
wasted no time in the prosecution of his love-affair and he
did not lack a friend in Lord Chester.</p>

<p>Consequently a strategic movement had brought about a
communication between the estranged lovers, and Earle's
tender letter, avowing his renewed love for Ladybird,
brought a repentant one from his darling that placed
everything on a very desirable footing, except that it was
impossible for them to meet. Mr. Stanley's ward was
guarded as jealously as any prisoner, and but for a servant
in the house, who was open to bribery, the letters of the
young lovers would never have reached them.</p>

<p>However, in spite of the opposing fates, Earle and
Arthur had planned a <i>coup de main</i> which, with Ladybird's
consent, was successfully carried out.</p>

<p>Aura Stanley was still too much in love with Earle
Winans to reject the dainty basket of roses that arrived
one morning by messenger with a note asking leave to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that evening, and signed duly by Lord Chester and
Earle.</p>

<p>"They think they will see Ladybird, but I will outwit
them," she thought angrily, and replied by giving them
permission to call.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley was charged not to let her weary little
slave escape from her couch that evening.</p>

<p>"Make her read aloud to you, mamma, or bathe your
forehead with camphor&mdash;anything, so that she does not
get a moment downstairs," Aura said imperiously, before
going down in her magnificent crimson silk gown, in
which she hoped to capture Earle's admiration if not his
heart.</p>

<p>And she thought she was succeeding when she saw how
his eyes lingered on her, and noted his smiles when she
adroitly referred to "last summer, when they had been
such friends, before that little misunderstanding."</p>

<p>He smiled and he said yes, but in a noncommittal way
that was rather puzzling. However, she thought they
were really getting on nicely, and was proud of the sociability
of her visitors, building high hopes for the future,
when suddenly a startling peal on the door-bell was followed
by the information that Mr. Winans was wanted at once
on important business, by some person unknown.</p>

<p>With profuse apologies to Aura for the interruption to
their call, the young gentlemen took their leave and went
out to their waiting carriage, leaving Aura alone in the
parlor, to dream rosy dreams of the future, evoked by the
smiles of that arch-deceiver, Earle Winans.</p>

<p>But in the midst of her rosy vision a servant appeared at
the door with the startling announcement:</p>

<p>"Miss Conway's compliments to you, miss, and she has
gone away to marry Mr. Winans."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Aura wildly gasped; and the
man, evidently in the secret, smiled broadly and replied:</p>

<p>"Just as I was letting the callers out at the door Miss
Conway came flying down the stairs in her hat and jacket,
and Mr. Winans took her hand and drew it in his arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Then she laughed and gave me that message for you, and
all three went away in the carriage together."</p>

<p>"Go! find my father! Bring him home instantly!"
shrieked Aura, white with fury. Then she flew upstairs
to her mother and blurted out the shocking news.</p>

<p>"Ladybird has gone away with Earle Winans to marry
him&mdash;eloped!&mdash;and I told you not to let her out of your
sight!" she raved, wringing her jeweled hands in angry
despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley sat up in bed, the picture of dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aura, I couldn't help it. All was going on well,
and she was bathing my head&mdash;she had said she was too
nervous to read&mdash;when suddenly that loud noise at the
door made her drop the camphor bottle and spill every
drop. She jumped up, and saying: 'Oh, excuse me, but
I must see what that noise is about,' ran out, and that was
the last I saw of the deceitful little jade!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if papa were only here, he could bring her back&mdash;couldn't
he, mamma?"</p>

<p>"No, Aura, for of course they would be married in
about ten minutes after they left here. You know Washington
is the easiest place in the world to get married in!
All the young runaway lovers come here to get married.
Of course those deceitful wretches had everything planned
for this escape. They must have exchanged letters somehow.
You may depend on it, Aura, that Ladybird is Mrs.
Winans by now. She has outwitted us, in spite of all our
care!"</p>

<p>It was true, as Mrs. Stanley said, Ladybird was Earle's
bride now, for every arrangement had been made for the
marriage, and they drove straight to the rectory of their
favorite minister and were made one, with his sympathetic
family and smiling Lord Chester for witnesses. Ten
minutes afterward the little bridal party walked into the
Winans' drawing-room where the family were entertaining
a few friends.</p>

<p>"Mamma, kiss your new daughter," Earle said gayly,
as he led Ladybird to his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was an elopement, and I was best man at the marriage,"
explained Lord Chester to the company in general.</p>

<p>No lovely, blushing bride ever received a more joyous
welcome into her husband's family than did our charming
Ladybird. They received her literally with open arms.</p>

<p>The story of the elopement having been gone over, the
bride was carried off to exchange her dark silk and sealskin
sacque for a soft white gown belonging to Precious. The
maid brought pearls for her neck and white flowers for her
corsage and hair.</p>

<p>"Now you look more like a bride," declared her delighted
sister-in-law, "Mamma shall buy you a trousseau
to-morrow, for of course those dreadful people will keep
all your nice things for spite. But never mind, they're
welcome to them, for Earle is rich in his own right, you
know, darling."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care if he was poor as a churchmouse, I
love him so dearly!" cried the radiant little bride, and she
laughed gayly out of her happy heart at Aura's terrible
discomfiture, and fancied how she must be scolding her
sick mother for letting the captive escape.</p>

<p>"Now let us go back to the company," said Precious,
and they returned arm in arm, both so beautiful in their
white robes that every eye turned on them in delight.</p>

<p>But they were scarcely seated before Lord Chester looked
around and said gravely:</p>

<p>"I have another surprise for you all."</p>

<p>And as they listened to him in amazement he continued:</p>

<p>"I received a cablegram from my father to-day, and he
announces that the claimant has gained the suit, while he
and I have lost wealth and title, and remain only loyal
British subjects."</p>

<p>Murmurs of surprise and sympathy arose all around him,
but he looked only at Ethel's pale, startled face and in a moment
he said to her lightly but with underlying earnestness:</p>

<p>"You have only three days left, Ethel, in which to
decide whether it was the man or the title you wished to
marry."</p>

<p>She only smiled in reply.</p>

</div></div>


<p>The news of Lord Chester's loss of title and wealth
spread very quickly, and in the shallow circles of society,
where money and position rate higher than brains and
worth, much commiseration was felt for brilliant Ethel
Winans, who had hoped so soon to be Lady Chester.
There were sneers, too, for of course envious people were
delighted at Ethel's disappointment.</p>

<p>But the cards for the marriage were out, the arrangements
made for a grand reception, after which the bridal
pair were to leave for Europe. The plans remained unchanged
still, and nobody was to be disappointed in the
grand show to which they looked forward with such eager
interest. The Winans family monopolized public interest
now, for in addition to Ethel's affair there was Earle's
elopement with that lovely fairy, Ladybird Conway.
Some pretty society belles were bitterly disappointed over
his marriage, as well as Aura Stanley, but they had to
smile and bear it. And when they saw the lovely bride
they could not blame him for his choice. She was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
most piquant little beauty that ever wiled a man's heart
away.</p>

<p>But a cruel pang came to the young bride's heart on the
very day after her marriage, for the uncertainty that hung
like a dark cloud over her father's fate became at last
absolute conviction of his death.</p>

<p>On that day there came to Mrs. Winans from the captain
of a newly arrived steamer in New York a letter and a
package.</p>

<p>The package contained a thick glass bottle and within
it was a closely written letter addressed to Senator Winans
and his wife. The sea-captain's letter informed Mrs.
Winans that the bottle had been picked up at sea during
his voyage. It had been securely sealed and on opening,
was found to contain a letter from the missing Mamaroneck,
and gave tidings of her almost certain fate.</p>

<p>With a shaking hand Mrs. Winans held the letter whose
writing was so familiar, and read above Bruce Conway's
signature the words he had penned to his dearest friends on
earth, as he fondly called them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">On Board the Mamaroneck</span>,          }<br />
July 20th, 189&mdash;.                  }<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Friends</span>:&mdash;On the eve of a calamity that means
nothing less than death, I write to you and commend to your care my
beloved daughter Lulu.</p>

<p>"In my will, made some time ago, I left the remainder of a much
depleted fortune to my daughter, and made my lawyer, Mr. Stanley,
of Rosemont, her guardian. But latterly I have questioned the wisdom
of my action in this matter. I am not certain of the man's
probity. What if he prove unjust to my daughter, faithless to my
charge? In the light of these doubts and fears I revoke that will,
and hereby declare this my last will and testament.</p>

<p>"To you, Paul Winans, whom I admire as the soul of honor and
rectitude, and to your wife, the noblest of living women, I leave in
trust my daughter and her fortune, the former a priceless jewel, the
latter less than it should be, for I have lost heavily in speculations;
but there still remains the splendid estate at Ocean View, inherited
from my aunt, my wife's jewels, worth twenty thousand dollars, and
some United States bonds to the value of fifteen thousand dollars.
All these are unincumbered by any debts, and are in the Rosemont
Bank, unless removed ere this by Mr. Stanley, who, in case he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
done so, will place them in your charge for my daughter. Until she
marries let her home be with you, and let her share, I pray you, in
the tender love you lavish on your own dear children. Once I
dreamed that the attachment between her and Earle might culminate
in a union that would bring both of them great happiness. Ladybird's
own folly wrecked my hopes. Tell Earle to forgive her. She
was but a willful child then, but she had a heart of gold.</p>

<p>"But time presses, for danger looms immediately before the
doomed passengers of the Mamaroneck. For two weeks we have
been sailing among a floe of icebergs, fifty in number, and our
destruction is inevitable. It is a ghastly fleet of death. We have
no chance of escape, for the berg nearest to us now will prove our
destruction. It is estimated at fifteen miles in length and seven
hundred feet in height. We have resigned ourselves to death with
brave hearts.</p>

<p>"I shall commit this letter to the sea in a sealed bottle, praying
Heaven that it may reach your hands. To all your lovely family,
and to my beloved daughter, I leave all my heart, and hope to meet
you all hereafter in that better land where I shall rest after being
hurled violently from earth-life by the approaching horror.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bruce Conway.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To the letter were appended as witnesses the names of
the Mamaroneck's captain and several passengers, well-known
New Yorkers. There could be no doubt of its
authenticity, and all hope was at an end. Since the writing
of that letter months had elapsed, and there remained no
longer a doubt of Ladybird's orphanage.</p>

<p>Lawyer Stanley, who was preparing to make a great
bluster over the abduction of his ward, was speedily cowed
when confronted with this unexpected testimony from the
dead. He was only too glad to make terms with Senator
Winans for silence as to his villainy by making restitution
of the fortune he had stolen from Ladybird, including the
jewels in which Aura had strutted her little day on the
social stage. The schemer was foiled and had to turn her
attention to other plans for making a rich marriage.</p>

<p>And what of Ethel?&mdash;beautiful Ethel, who had dreamed
of wearing a coronet on her haughty brow, but who after
all would only be the bride of an English gentleman of
small fortune and high birth!</p>

<p>Only God and Ethel knew of the night in which she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
battle with her own heart, going over and over in her mind
Arthur's words, half-gay, half-earnest:</p>

<p>"You have only three days in which to decide whether
it was the man or the title you wished to marry."</p>

<p>The words rang in her ears all night, and his look was
always before her eyes.</p>

<p>It did not take three days for her to decide. Twelve
hours were long enough.</p>

<p>When he came for his usual morning call next day,
Ethel met him alone in a pretty little room where they
often sat together.</p>

<p>She had never looked more beautiful, but she was very,
very pale, so much so that as he touched her slender hand
he exclaimed anxiously:</p>

<p>"How pale you look, Ethel, and your dear hand is icy-cold.
Are you ill, dear?"</p>

<p>"I did not rest well last night," she replied evasively.</p>

<p>He stood still, with her hand still carelessly clasped in
his, studying her face with anxious eyes, and with a half-sigh,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You were grieving perhaps over my loss of rank and
fortune!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied frankly, and drew her hand away
so gently that he scarcely noticed it.</p>

<p>Ethel's dark head drooped a little as if in shame, and
she murmured hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Arthur, you will despise me when you learn the truth.
I&mdash;I&mdash;am very ambitious. I valued your rank and fortune
highly. I had set my heart on having a title. But I
loved you, too, or&mdash;thought I did. But now I find&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, unable to continue for a moment, and
Arthur, looking steadily at her, began to comprehend her
drift.</p>

<p>He began to despise her, but he would not help her out
by one poor word.</p>

<p>He saw the white hands writhing in and out of each
other, saw her look at him quickly, then drop her eyes
again, but he did not dream what was in that swift look,
the momentary hope, the succeeding despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>She found her voice and continued:</p>

<p>"All is altered now, and I&mdash;oh, Arthur, forgive me, but&mdash;I
cannot marry you now!"</p>

<p>It was a frightened gasp, and she grew pale as her snowy
morning gown, as she stole another glance at his face.</p>

<p>It was cold, proud, angry. She had given his self-esteem
a cruel blow, and stricken down his faith in her
at one fell stroke.</p>

<p>"You despise me!" she faltered, and he answered
icily:</p>

<p>"Do you not deserve it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured deeply. "My love was a poor
thing, Arthur. It could not stand the test of your loss of
rank and fortune. But you will not grieve for me. It
was a lucky escape to lose a bride who lived only for ambition
as I do. But&mdash;there is another with a truer heart
than mine. Go to her, Arthur&mdash;to Precious&mdash;you can
win her love, and she will make you happy."</p>

<p>He turned from her with scorn.</p>

<p>"Take your freedom, Miss Winans&mdash;you are welcome
to it," he said bitterly, and hurried from the room; his
heart swelling with wounded pride. He had never really
loved her, but he had admired and respected her so much
that he recoiled in pain from the knowledge that she had
never really loved him at all and that she was at heart
cold, scheming, and ambitious&mdash;a woman to throw aside a
lover like a worn-out glove!</p>

<p>Arthur sought Senator Winans in the library, where
he was discussing Bruce Conway's letter with his wife, and
as calmly as he could he told them of Ethel's decision.</p>

<p>They were startled, dismayed. The great statesman
paled with shame and anger. While his wife wept he raved
in impotent fury.</p>

<p>"That a daughter of mine could have been willing to
sell herself for a coronet, and to shirk the bargain like this
in the eyes of all the world!&mdash;it is infamous, detestable!
I will not permit it; she shall marry you! Wait here,
Arthur, until I bring her to reason!" he exclaimed, starting
to the door.</p>

<p>"No, no," and two white hands clasped his arm and held
him back. "No, Paul, you must not go to Ethel. Arthur
does not want an unwilling bride!"</p>

<p>"No, never!" cried the young man proudly. "Remain,
senator, for I am quite satisfied. My pride is wounded
more than my heart. I shall soon get over the blow."</p>

<p>"I will never forgive Ethel!" cried the angry senator.
"She has shamed her mother and me before the whole world.
People will point the finger of scorn at her and at us. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
has always been proud and strange, this girl; but I did not
dream she was so ignoble at heart. Henceforth, she can
be a daughter only in name to me, for she has forfeited
both love and respect. Oh, how different it would have
been had you loved my favorite daughter instead of heartless
Ethel! Precious would only have loved you the better
for your misfortunes!"</p>

<p>Arthur held up his hand suddenly with an entreating
gesture.</p>

<p>"Senator&mdash;and you, Mrs. Winans&mdash;will you permit me
to make a confession to you?" he asked humbly, eagerly,
and all in a breath he confessed the love for Precious that
he had been struggling against for weary months because
his troth belonged to queenly Ethel.</p>

<p>Senator Winans was confused, amazed. His wife sobbed
quietly without looking up, and then Arthur said pleadingly:</p>

<p>"So all has happened for the best, and I bear no grudge
against Miss Winans. I would have made her a good husband,
but at heart I should have felt myself a traitor. Ah,
senator, will you give me your permission to speak to
Precious?"</p>

<p>"We cannot give Precious to any one," faltered the
senator's wife.</p>

<p>"Hush, darling, or Arthur will think we are mercenary,
like Ethel. Arthur shall have his chance with the rest,
for we cannot hope to keep our darling from loving some
one and making him happy as you did me, dear Gracie; so
he may woo and win Precious if he can."</p>

<p>"I shall speak to her at once," cried the young lover in
a tremor of joy, and turning to the door saw Precious
standing on the threshold just entering.</p>

<p>Ethel had told her the truth with a careless smile; and
full of indignation over her sister's cruelty, she had come
to seek her parents.</p>

<p>But when she saw Arthur she drew back embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;thought you were gone!" she murmured
blushingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he answered, and took her hand and drew her
forward, saying: "Precious, I have been making a confidant
of your parents. They know that Ethel has jilted
me, and they have been told also how my heart strayed
from her to you. I love you still, and they have given me
leave to tell you so. Ah, Precious, there is no barrier
between us now, and your heart may speak. Can you learn
to love me now, or are you ambitious, like Ethel?"</p>

<p>At the name of Ethel the blue eyes flashed, and Precious
held out her hand impulsively, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Ethel has treated you wickedly, cruelly; so why should
I deny that I love you, Arthur? I will never forgive her
for being so heartless, and I love you the better for all
your misfortunes!"</p>

<p>Senator Winans and his wife kindly turned their heads
aside just then, for they could not blame Arthur for kissing
their charming daughter.</p>

<p>Then he led her to her mother, who embraced her and
sighed:</p>

<p>"This is so sudden it cannot be real. Are you sure you
love Arthur, my darling?"</p>

<p>"I have loved him ever since he saved my life, mamma;
but he belonged to Ethel, and so I tried to overcome my
heart. But I am very glad Ethel did not care for him any
more, for now I may love him without shame."</p>

<p>"And you can marry me on Thursday instead of
Ethel!" exclaimed the happy lover in a burst of hopeful
confidence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, you take one's breath away with your
hasty plans!" laughed Precious, while her mother clasped
her tighter, as though this bold lover were going to kidnap
Precious at that very moment.</p>

<p>But Arthur persisted:</p>

<p>"My passage and Ethel's are taken on the steamer for
Thursday, and my father expects me. He is old and weak,
and I do not like to disappoint him. Precious and I are
very much in love with each other, and we have still two
days to court in, so why should we not carry out the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
programme, with the one exception of changed brides?
It would make me very happy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winans and Precious offered quick demurrers, but
to their surprise Senator Winans joined forces with Arthur,
and declared that the plan would please him, as it would
show the world that one of his daughters had a true,
womanly heart, although the other's was incased in a steel
armor of pride, vanity and ambition.</p>

<p>Senator Winans usually carried his point, and his wife
and daughter soon came round to his opinion. Finally
the parents sent the young people off to bill and coo, while
they talked matters over and decided how best to smooth
over the whole affair to the world.</p>

<p>They had to bring in Earle, too, and intrust him with
the task of breaking to his bonny bride the news of the
letter from the sea with the certainty of her father's fate.</p>

<p>But the news of Bruce Conway's loss at sea scarcely
surprised Earle so much as that of Ethel's strange conduct.
Like his father, he was very angry.</p>

<p>"I can scarcely realize it," he exclaimed; "I could
have sworn that her love was as strong as her life. Why,
she seemed to worship Arthur!"</p>

<p>"It was only his title she worshiped," Ethel's father
replied angrily, and Earle rejoiced with him that Precious
would make up to Arthur for Ethel's defection.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," Earle said presently. "Ladybird will
have to go into mourning for her father, so she cannot
enter society this winter. We will go abroad with Arthur
and Precious, and make it a double bridal tour."</p>

<p>They agreed with him that it was a good idea, and then
he went, with the letter from the sea, to his bride.</p>

<p>"I must go now to Ethel, but you need not come with
me, Paul, for you would only scold her, and of course the
poor child feels badly enough now," said Mrs. Winans;
but all that she could urge did not prevent the irate father
from reprimanding his elder daughter in very strong terms
for her heartless conduct, that he assured her had brought
a disgrace on the family that could only be wiped out by
the nobility Precious had displayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel did not have one word to say in her own defense.
She received her father's reprimand in cold, proud silence
more irritating than any retort, then turned away. But
to Precious and all the others Ethel was kind and gracious
in spite of a certain coldness that every one but her mother
displayed toward her. How could they help it when she
had acted so abominably?</p>

<p>Ethel did not resent their anger. She endured it
humbly, and even took an interest in the bustle of preparations
that followed on the change of brides. There
was so much to do to get Precious ready for the rôle of
bride instead of bridesmaid that every one was busy. The
bridal gown was altered to fit the slender form of Precious,
the bridal veil was given to her with a smile.</p>

<p>Every one wondered at Ethel's humility, and they began
to forgive her in their hearts in spite of themselves, for she
even offered to be the maid of honor.</p>

<p>"I want to do everything to make you happy, dear,"
she said, with a light caress on the golden head, "and by
and by you'll be glad, Precious, that my selfishness left
Arthur free for you. He will love you better than he
could have loved me. Every one does, you know."</p>

<p>There was a tear and a sigh behind the smile, but
Precious did not notice it. She was very, very happy,
our little heroine, and life lay before her all bright and
joyous with the sunshine of love and the flowers of hope
on her life-path.</p>

<p>Ethel's story leaked out to the world as such stories
will, and society declared it was not at all surprised. Her
pride and ambition and heartlessness were well known to
the world, declared the knowing ones.</p>

<p>But surely she would not have the hardihood to attend
the wedding, said everybody. It would be a sensation if
she did that, certainly.</p>

<p>But Ethel gave them the sensation. She went to church
with the bride, as maid of honor, she smiled at the bridegroom
when the ceremony was over; but while people were
saying it was a wonder she went to the church she knew
in her heart that she would rather have gone to the stake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>How slowly the time went, how wearisome the reception,
how could they all seem so smiling and happy, she
thought again and again until it was all over, and
Precious had put off her bridal white for her traveling
gown and was saying her farewells.</p>

<p>Kay was going too, Precious could not leave him, she
declared; and indeed her pet would have been inconsolable.
So the beautiful lion-like fellow went into the carriage
with his mistress, who sobbed bitterly as her father
leaned in at the door for a second farewell.</p>

<p>"Half my life seems going with you, darling," he
sighed.</p>

<p>"I shall bring her back to you in the summer for a
visit," promised happy Arthur Chester.</p>

<p>"And we will stay at dear old Rosemont," declared
Precious; and the last glimpse they had of the fair young
face was wreathed in smiles, though the eyes were violets
drowned in tears.</p>

<p>The carriages rolled away with Arthur and Precious,
Earle and Ladybird, and there was only Ethel left now&mdash;Ethel
standing by her mother's side, tall and queenly in
her bridesmaid's gown, but pale, and with tears in her
burning eyes. Mrs. Winans had been sobbing on her
husband's shoulder, but now she went to the solitary
figure and clasped her in her arms.</p>

<p>"We have only you left, dear one; we will have to love
you more than ever; will we not, Paul?" she murmured,
but with a stifled exclamation he left the room. In his
heart there was no forgiveness for his heartless daughter.</p>

<p>"You look tired, my dear. This excitement has wearied
you. Go now to your room," Mrs. Winans said, kissing
her a tender good-night. "You must rest and sleep."</p>

<p>"I am very tired," Ethel answered listlessly, as she
turned away, crushing between her teeth some words that
sounded like, "I should like to sleep&mdash;forever!"</p>

<p>The family slept late next morning after the fatigues
and griefs of last night, and Ethel did not join her parents
at breakfast. But an hour later her maid came to the library
with a message. Would her parents see her in her
boudoir for a few minutes?</p>

<p>An angry frown came to Senator Winans' brow.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to go down to the capitol; I have no
time for Ethel," he said curtly.</p>

<p>But the beautiful wife he worshiped so tenderly drew
her arm through his, whispering fondly, "Come," and
he could not gainsay her imperial will.</p>

<p>Ethel was lying back wearily in a large armchair in her
luxurious boudoir, with its furnishings of rose and gold.
Her attire was peculiar.</p>

<p>She wore a long, straight black gown, very simple and
severe in style, and a long black lace scarf was wound
turban fashion about her regal brow, concealing every
thread of her rich dark hair. As the door closed she
motioned them to seats, and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I have sent for you to ask your leave to enter a convent&mdash;to
become a nun!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ethel!"</p>

<p>"Ethel!"</p>

<p>The cry came first from the mother's lips, and was
echoed by the father. Shocked surprise was in both
voices.</p>

<p>She stood up tall and stately confronting them, her face
corpse-white by contrast with her black attire and somber
dark eyes. In an anguished voice she cried:</p>

<p>"I have sinned deeply, I am not worthy of your love,
mamma, papa! I wish to retire into a convent and spend
my life in expiating my sin!"</p>

<p>"I will never consent," Senator Winans exclaimed
sternly. "You have behaved badly, shamefully, but you
can repent at home as well as within convent walls."</p>

<p>She flung herself on her knees at his feet, a tragic
despair on the dusky beauty of her dark face.</p>

<p>"Papa, I kneel to you, because I have a terrible confession
to make to you and mamma," she cried hoarsely.
"It must be told to you; because in the dark of last night
I repented my sins, and I bury the dark secret in my
heart no longer. I must tell you all, and then you will
despise me so much you will be glad and willing for me
to hide my unhappy life in convent walls!"</p>

<p>They were so amazed and startled they could not move
or speak to interrupt their daughter; and there, upon
her knees, her face colorless, her eyes like black stars,
Ethel poured forth her wretched story&mdash;the envy and
jealousy that made her hate her little sister and wish her
dead.</p>

<p>Nothing was kept back; nothing glossed over. Ethel
painted her sins as black as her worst enemy could have
done.</p>

<p>"When I came away and left my sister in the burning
house I was a murderess at heart," she said. "When I
stole her love letter from under her pillow and then made
her give Arthur to me I was a fiend, and then I betrayed
her into the power of a devil. And, papa, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
little revolver you gave her, he might have murdered my
little sister!"</p>

<p>They could only look and listen, they were speechless
with surprise and horror. Ethel's self-arraignment was
tragic in its intensity.</p>

<p>She went on wildly:</p>

<p>"Yet Precious forgave me&mdash;kept my hideous secrets,
loved me, and forgave me. Can you fancy anything so
angelic? Can you fancy how even my wicked heart was
touched, how at last I began to repent, and to long to
atone for my evil deeds? Alas! there was but one way!
I began to wonder how I could give Arthur back to her,
for I knew she was too noble to take him away, believing
that I loved him! Suddenly the way opened clearly
before me. Do you understand, papa?"</p>

<p>A startled cry came from the senator's lips, and Ethel
continued in that anguished voice:</p>

<p>"You blamed me, upbraided me, papa, for jilting
Arthur, yet it was the noblest act of my wayward life, my
atonement to Precious for all my sins."</p>

<p>With a sudden movement of her hand she pushed from
her brows the black lace turban. It fell at his feet, and
Ethel's wealth of hair swept unbound about her shoulders
like a stream of silver.</p>

<p>In the sleepless agony of one long night all those raven
tresses had faded to beautiful silvery white!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Look at the work of one night's agony," sobbed Ethel.
"Do you think now I did not love him more than wealth
and title? Do you think I could not have been happy
with Arthur on a crust and in a hovel? Yes, but he
belonged to her by the God-given right of their mutual
love. So I gave him up for her sake! But last night!&mdash;oh,
last night, what suffering, what cruel jealousy of what
I had lost! And with morning's dawn all this!" She
flung back her whitened locks with a restless hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
continued: "But, dear ones, this is <i>our</i> secret. Arthur
and Precious must <i>never</i> know that I loved him so madly
it almost killed me to give up my poor claim on him.
When I am dead, perhaps, you may tell them the truth,
but not till then, for I would not make her unhappy!"</p>

<p>They looked at the beautiful guilty creature, and their
hearts yearned over her, her repentance and atonement
were so beautiful and perfect. Good had triumphed
over evil in her complex nature, and the victory was
complete.</p>

<p>"You have heard all now. You will not wish me near
you, you will not oppose my wish to enter a convent,"
she said pleadingly.</p>

<p>But the strong nature of Senator Winans had been
stirred to its very depths by the story he had heard. He
rose and drew his daughter to his breast.</p>

<p>"Ethel, I have wronged you," he said tenderly and
humbly. "It was from me you inherited your jealous
nature, and I have blamed you instead of shielding you
and guarding you against your inherited nature. I
should have loved you more and blamed you less. It was
hard for you to be good, while it was easy for Precious,
with all her mother's gentle traits. Dear, we cannot let
you go from us to expiate your sins. Stay with us, and
we will love you more, and help you to be true to your
better nature."</p>

<p>She clung to him like a tired child.</p>

<p>"And you will forgive me all, papa?&mdash;as Precious did,
sweet angel!"</p>

<p>"I will forgive you all, and you must forgive me, dear.
I have been to blame for all. Now promise me you will
try to be happy again."</p>

<p>"If you will try to love me again, dear papa! You
know how I have always worshiped you."</p>

<p>She felt his tears on her brow&mdash;a strong man's tears&mdash;and
knew she had won a warmer place than ever before in
his noble heart.</p>

<p>From that hour a new life began for Ethel. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
none the less beautiful because of that crown of snow-white
tresses, but she did not care for admiration now.
It was not likely she would ever marry.</p>

<p>And she rejoiced as much as any one when in the summer
that letter came from Earle telling them that the new
Earl of Fairfield, a vulgar boor, had broken his neck on the
hunting field, and that Arthur had come into his rights
again.</p>

<p>"Little Blue Eyes will be a countess some day, and
Ladybird declares that a coronet will become her royally,"
wrote Earle, in his pride over his favorite sister; but no
thrill of jealousy stirred Ethel's tranquil heart. She had
conquered herself in a hard-fought battle, and in all the
world there was to her no dearer name than Precious.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="center"><i>An Original Translation from the French, and for the First Time
Done into English.</i></p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center medium">SOME PRESS COMMENTS.</p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is the tinted title of a 'Romance of the Cloak and Sword.'
It is brisk in style, crisp in dialogue, and intensely colorful. ... 'Belle-Rose'
will be belle-read if a good, quick story has any charms for the fair."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Call.</i></p>

<p>"Emile Faguet speaks of the 'Belle-Rose' of Amédée Achard as superior
to 'Le Capitaine Fracasse,' by Théophile Gautier. The purest love of woman,
the fidelity of man, the sacredness of friendship, intrigues of the court,
jealousies and revenge, a delightful touch of humor or pathos coming to the
relief at some tragic climax, give to the story a fascination for the reader."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Eagle.</i></p>

<p>"The charm that is always to be found in the works of the best French
writers&mdash;quick, terse description, bright dialogue, rapidly shifting scenes
and incidents, leading up to intense climaxes&mdash;is well sustained in the story
of 'Belle-Rose.'"&mdash;<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is a romance of love and war in the middle of the 17th
Century. It is true to the life of those troublous times, when the soldier
was such from youth to old age, resting only between battles to make love.
The translation is very good, indeed."&mdash;<i>Post-Intelligencer.</i></p>

<p>"The story is full of love and passion, jealousy and revenge, the buffets
and rewards of war, with flashes of humor, and just those touches of nature
that make the whole world kin."&mdash;<i>Nashville American.</i></p>

<p>"Among the works of fiction there are few which partake of the character
of an historical romance, and when one is found that does it is appreciated.
Such an one is 'Belle-Rose,' by Amédée Achard. The author has
the knack of giving the details of a scene, or describing a character in so
few words that they might be likened unto pen sketches, and he carries the
reader along with something of the impetuous dash and fiery ardor that his
hero is so full of. The translation is very good."&mdash;<i>St. Louis Star.</i></p>

<p>"Amédée Achard's romance of old France, 'Belle-Rose,' is a story of
incessant movement, warfare, intrigue, and all the elements which go to
the composition of an ingenious tale of love and adventure. The translation
is admirable."&mdash;<i>Buffalo Courier.</i></p>

<p>"This story, the scenes of which are laid near Paris during the latter
part of the 17th Century, is one of those romances about the life of a soldier
during that bloody age, which seems to prove a great attraction to all
classes of readers. Fierce fighting, hair-breadth escapes, court intrigues,
are all blended with love-making, rescuing beauty in distress, and description
of the customs of the people in that age."&mdash;<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

<p>"'Belle-Rose' is a brilliant story, by Amédée Achard, one of the most
effective of French romance writers. It is a story of love and war, introducing
famous historical characters of the period, and will be read with
deep interest."&mdash;<i>Minneapolis Journal.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' by Clement R. Marley, is a bright and
pleasing story. The love story of the old bachelor, whose heart was so
long steeled to woman's charms, but who succumbs at last to the girl who
attempts to take the life of his best friend because she imagines he wronged
her young and beautiful sister, is prettily told."&mdash;<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' is a story whose narration is simple and
direct, but it has also a freshness and vivacity which add greatly to its
charms. The characters are well drawn."&mdash;<i>Newark Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"An entertaining story, telling of the capture of the heart of an old
bachelor."&mdash;<i>New York Press.</i></p>

<p>"A story of most unconventional type. The theme is good, and it is
well told. It is all very natural and true to life, and when all is said and
done it lingers in the mind as a pleasant memory."&mdash;<i>Nashville American.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' is a very pleasing love story, most entertainingly
told."&mdash;<i>Fort Worth Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The author tells a very unconventional story in 'Richard Forrest,
Bachelor,' and it is very entertaining."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' the author gives a very pretty story.
There are strong religious sentiments, and the author puts forth some well-defined
ideas on the social relations of men and women."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Call.</i></p>

<p>"A novel of more than usual interest is 'Richard Forrest, Bachelor.' It
describes scenes and incidents that may be seen and experienced by any
one in similar circumstances. There is much that is strange and stirring in
the story, yet nature is not departed from either in the incidents or characters
introduced."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Citizen.</i></p>

<p>"A well-told tale of sustained interest and dramatic character."&mdash;<i>Sacramento
Record-Union.</i></p>

<p>"The author tells the story of an old bachelor's love. He gets well along
in life invulnerable to Cupid's dart, and then he detects the woman of his
heart's choice in an attempt upon the life of his bosom friend, to avenge an
imaginary wrong. It is very true to life."&mdash;<i>Atlanta Journal.</i></p>

<p>"'Richard Forrest, Bachelor,' is after the style of 'Mr. Barnes of New
York,' but is rather better written."&mdash;<i>Hartford Times.</i></p>

"moving accidents by flood and field." The reader will

tale, through all their trials, and gladly share the sorrows
and the joys of the heroes, both men and women, whose
love was tried by the fire of war.</p>

  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
